 # CHANGELOG

## [2.2.34] - 2026-09-24

---

### CHANGED: "Already Have an Active Package?" Button Restored Above the Plans

**`system/plugin/download.php`**

- The **Already Have an Active Package?** button is back in the top button stack, directly below **Redeem Voucher**, so the two shortcut buttons sit together again as they did before 2.2.33.
- The login card it drives stays hidden — this change is only about the button being visible and in that position.
- Worth knowing how the two interact: the button's `onclick` is `document.getElementById('submitBtn').click()`, and `#submitBtn` lives inside that hidden card. A programmatic click still fires, and it submits the hidden `#loginForm` to the hotspot login endpoint using whatever `#usernameInput` holds — which is auto-filled from the `accountid` cookie. So for a returning customer whose device already carries that cookie the button signs them straight in; for a first-time visitor there is nothing to submit, because the field they would type into is hidden.
- If the button should work for everyone, the two obvious options are to reveal the hidden card when it is pressed, or to prompt for the account number in a dialog. Neither is included here.

## [2.2.33] - 2026-09-24

---

### CHANGED: "Already Have an Active Package?" Login Form Hidden on the Hotspot Page

**`system/plugin/download.php`**

- The login card (account-number field and Connect button) is no longer visible to customers, and the **Already Have an Active Package?** shortcut button was removed from the button stack. What remains on the page is **Redeem Voucher** and the **FREE TRIAL 10 MINS** link.
- It is **hidden, not deleted, and that distinction matters**: this form is the page's login mechanism. The JavaScript submits `#loginForm` to the hotspot login endpoint to sign the customer in automatically after a successful M-Pesa payment, a voucher redemption and a reconnect, and `#usernameInput` holds the account id that the payment-status polling is keyed on. Deleting the markup would have broken all four flows, so the container is hidden with `display:none` and the elements stay in the DOM.
- A hidden form still submits normally, so every automatic sign-in keeps working; only the manual entry point is gone.
- Also fixed a pre-existing console error: the `DOMContentLoaded` handler for `#submitBtnTop` called `addEventListener` on a null reference, because no element with that id has ever existed on this page. It is now guarded with `if (!submitBtnTop) return;`.

## [2.2.32] - 2026-09-24

---

### CHANGED: Hotspot Page No Longer Lists Packages, and the Phone Reconnect Button Is Gone

**`system/plugin/download.php`**

- The package grid (`#cards-container`) is no longer rendered, so customers no longer see the 5-Hours / 24-Hours / 7-Days / 30-Days cards. What remains is **Redeem Voucher**, **Already Have an Active Package?** (the account login form) and the **FREE TRIAL 10 MINS** link.
- The **Reconnect with Phone Number** button was removed from the button stack.
- The card renderer was deliberately left in place: `populateCards()` now returns early because the container is absent, so showing the packages again is a matter of restoring the container markup rather than rewriting the renderer. The company-name and customer-care updates still happen, since those assignments run before the early return.
- Worth knowing: `reconnectWithNumber()` and the `reconnect_phone` POST handler are still in the file but unreferenced from the UI. The endpoint stays directly reachable by POST, so it can be deleted as well if the capability should be gone rather than just hidden.
- Customers can no longer buy a package from this page at all - purchases now go through vouchers. Say the word if that was not the intent.

## [2.2.31] - 2026-09-24

---

### CHANGED: Prices Hidden from Customers on the Hotspot Page

**`system/plugin/download.php`**

- The hotspot plan cards no longer display a price. Each card keeps its plan name, the MOST POPULAR badge and the validity line, so the customer chooses by what they get rather than by what it costs.
- The payment confirmation dialog no longer states the amount either — it now reads "Enter your Mpesa number below and click **Pay Now** to initialize the payment". If you would rather the customer still saw the figure at the moment of paying, that single line is easy to restore.
- The now-unused price plumbing went with it: the `price` argument on the Buy button, the third parameter of `handlePhoneNumberSubmission()`, and the fallback that scraped the figure out of the card's DOM (which also depended on the implicit global `event`).
- Nothing about payment changed. The `grant` request sends only `{phone_number, plan_id, router_id, account_id}` — the amount has always been resolved server-side from the plan — so `price` in the page was display-only.
- Prices remain in `tbl_plans` and are still returned by the `plugin/hotspot_plan` endpoint; only the customer-facing display has gone.

## [2.2.30] - 2026-09-22

---

### CHANGED: Shared Value Chips on the Customer Profile and Package Cards

**`ui/ui/customers-view.tpl`**

- The left-hand profile card was a wall of plain right-aligned text with a single coloured pill on Status. It now uses the same chip system as the package card, so the two cards read as one design:
  - **Status** and **Auto Renewal** → green/red pills
  - **Service Type** → blue chip
  - **Balance** → amber chip (money, matching how Expires On is treated on the package card)
  - **Username**, **Phone Number**, **Email**, **Account Type**, **PPPOE Username**, **PPPOE Remote IP**, plus the package card's **Bandwidth** and recharge method → slate monospace chips, marking them as identifiers you would copy out rather than prose
  - **City**, **Created On**, **Last Login** stay plain — dates and place names do not benefit from being boxed
- The chip classes (`sr-chip`, `sr-chip-ok`, `sr-chip-bad`, `sr-chip-info`, `sr-chip-money`, `sr-chip-mute`, `sr-chip-mono`) are defined once and drive both cards, instead of each card carrying its own colour rules that could drift apart. **Status** moved off `sr-status-pill` / `sr-status-on` / `sr-status-off` onto `sr-chip-ok` / `sr-chip-bad`; the old rules are left in place since other markup may still use them.
- Every label gained a small icon in a fixed 14px slot, matching the package card. The icons are deliberately low-contrast (`#cbd5e1`) so they aid scanning without competing with the values.
- Monospace chips are capped at `max-width: 60%` with `min-width: 0` and an ellipsis, so a long email address truncates cleanly instead of forcing the row wide. `min-width: 0` matters specifically because a flex item defaults to `min-width: auto` and would otherwise refuse to shrink, defeating the ellipsis.
- **Auto Renewal**, and the package card's **Active** flag, displayed a bare lowercase `yes` / `no`; both now show `Yes` / `No` via `Lang::T()`, so the two cards render these the same way.

## [2.2.29] - 2026-09-22

---

### FIXED: Plan Sync Could Disconnect Customers, Report False Success and Replay Batches

**`system/controllers/plan.php` + `ui/ui/plan-sync.tpl`**

- **False success.** `plan/sync-process` called `$device->add_customer()` and ignored its return value, then recorded `status => 'success'` unconditionally. `add_customer()` returns `false` when the router is unreachable or the change is rejected, so a router that was down still produced a green "Synced" for every customer in the batch. The return value is now honoured, and failures are reported per customer as "Router unreachable or refused the sync".
- **Destructive sync.** `add_customer()` deletes the hotspot user together with their active session and then re-adds them, so every online customer in a sync was disconnected and had their counters reset. `sync_customer()`, which exists on both device classes and simply re-points the existing user at the plan's profile, had no call sites anywhere in the codebase. `sync-process` now prefers it and falls back to `add_customer()` only when the device does not provide one (`MikrotikPppoe::sync_customer()` delegates to `add_customer()`, so PPPoE behaviour is unchanged).
- **Unstable paging.** The batch query used `limit(10)->offset($n)` with no `ORDER BY`, so MySQL was free to return rows in any order and customers could be skipped or synced twice between batches. It is now ordered by `id`.
- **`hasMore` mismatch.** The flag was computed from the requested `limit` rather than the rows actually returned, while the caller advances its offset by `stats.processed`. It now uses the real batch size.
- **Unbounded timeout replay.** On a client timeout the page re-requested the same offset with no retry cap, and the UI stayed locked if that kept happening. The arithmetic made this near-certain: `MikrotikHotspot::getClient()` makes 3 connect attempts of 5s with 2s delays, so a dead router costs ~19s per customer and a batch of 10 needs ~190s — against a 60s client timeout and a 120s `set_time_limit`. The server limit is now 300s, the client timeout 330s so that it exceeds the server, and retries are capped at 2 before stopping with the offset and a hint on how to resume.
- **Missing CSRF protection.** The endpoint rewrites router state over a plain GET, so any page an authenticated admin visited could trigger a sync with an `<img>` tag. It now validates a CSRF token, which `plan/sync` supplies to every batch request. `Csrf::check()` does not consume the token, so one token covers a whole run, and the check remains a no-op unless `csrf_enabled` is `yes`.

## [2.2.28] - 2026-09-22

---

### CHANGED: Sub District / Ward removed from Administrator forms

**`ui/ui/admin-add.tpl` + `admin-edit.tpl` + `admin-view.tpl` + `admin.tpl` + `system/controllers/settings.php`**

- The Administrator add/edit forms drop the **Sub District** and **Ward** inputs; the address row keeps **City**, which now spans the full width of the form group.
- The Administrator detail page no longer shows Sub District or Ward rows — neither for the account itself nor for the linked Sales agent panel.
- The administrator list no longer renders `city, subdistrict, ward`; it shows the city only, so there is no stray `, ,` left behind.
- `settings.php` no longer reads `subdistrict` / `ward` from POST and no longer writes those columns on add or edit, so saving a user can never blank out legacy values.
- Mirrors 2.2.06, which removed District / State / Zip from the customer forms. Existing `tbl_users.subdistrict` and `ward` values are left untouched in the database — the columns are simply no longer displayed or written.

## [2.2.27] - 2026-09-22

---

### FIXED: "Actions" Dropdown Menu Was Clipped Behind the Profile Card

**`ui/ui/customers-view.tpl`**

- The **Actions** menu on the profile card (Sync / Reconnect / Enable Customer / Disable Customer / Send Message / Login as Customer) was being swallowed by the card instead of floating above it.
- Cause: the rounded-card treatment set `overflow: hidden` on `.sr-profile` (v2.2.21) and again on `.sr-cust .box` (v2.2.22) so that child backgrounds would be cut to the new `16px` / `14px` radius. Bootstrap 3 positions `.dropdown-menu` **inside** the card, so that clip removed the menu along with the corners.
- Both rules are now overridden to `overflow: visible`. This is safe because nothing inside these cards actually reaches a corner:
- `.sr-cust .box-header` is forced to `background: #fff !important`, so it is invisible against the white card
- both `box-footer` strips in this template are already transparent (the "Last Updated" strip and the Live Bandwidth strip)
- `.list-group` items are transparent and sit inside the `.box-profile` `18px` padding, so they never touch the radius
- The override is declared after both original rules at matching specificity, so it wins without `!important`. Cards that set `overflow:hidden` **inline** (the monthly-usage card) keep their own clipping, since inline styles beat a non-`!important` rule.

### CHANGED: Actions Menu Now Anchored Inside the Card

**`ui/ui/customers-view.tpl`**

- The menu was left-aligned (`left: 0`) on a button sitting at the right edge of the card, so its labels ran off the card and were truncated mid-word (`Enable Cust...`, `Disable Cust...`). It is now right-anchored (`right: 0; left: auto`) with `min-width: 200px`.
- Menu labels no longer wrap (`white-space: nowrap`), and items gained a 6px offset below the button plus aligned 16px icon slots so the leading icons line up in a column.

## [2.2.26] - 2026-09-20

---

### FIXED: Download and Upload Were Swapped on the Live Bandwidth Panel
**`system/controllers/customers.php`, `ui/ui/customers-view.tpl`**

- On a PPPoE session the panel showed the customer's **uplink as Download** and their **downlink as Upload** — a browsing subscriber would see e.g. `DOWNLOAD 307.96 Kbps` / `UPLOAD 4.12 Mbps`, with the chart's green Download line pinned at zero while the blue Upload line carried all the traffic.
- Root cause: MikroTik counters are **router-perspective**, but the panel labelled them client-perspective.
- `/interface/print` → `rx-byte` on `<pppoe-user>` = traffic the router **received from** the customer = **Upload**
- `/interface/print` → `tx-byte` on `<pppoe-user>` = traffic the router **sent to** the customer = **Download**
- `/ip hotspot active` → `bytes-in` / `bytes-out` follow the same convention
- `live_stats` fed those into generic `bytes_in` / `bytes_out` keys, and the template rendered `bytes_in` as the Download card, the Download chart series and "Session Total DL". The `in`/`out` naming is what hid the inversion.
- The endpoint now emits **explicitly named `download` / `upload`** keys, and the template consumes them directly, so the two can no longer be crossed.
- The devices table on the same page carried the identical inversion — its Download column read `bytes_in` and its Upload column read `bytes_out`. Those two cells are now swapped to match (`mikrotik_device_info.php` names PPPoE `rx-byte` as `bytes_in`, so `bytes_out` is the download).
- Verified against the codebase's own convention: `system/plugin/ui/mikrotik_monitor.tpl` pairs the header `Download (TX)` with DataTable column `tx_bytes` and `Upload (RX)` with `rx_bytes`, and `system/plugin/mikrotik_monitor.php` fills `rxBytes` from `bytes-in` / `rx-byte`.

> **Known related issue (not changed in this release):** the monthly-usage pipeline is inverted the same way. `monthly_usage_process_session()` passes `$bytes_in` (upload) into `monthly_usage_accumulate()` as `delta_in`, which is written to `tbl_customer_monthly_usage.download_bytes` — so stored monthly totals have download/upload swapped, affecting the Monthly Data Usage panel, `dashboard.php`, `home.php` and `peak_hours_report.php`. Correcting it needs a decision on back-filling existing rows, so it is tracked separately.

## [2.2.25] - 2026-09-20

---

### CHANGED: Modernised Action Bar, Live Bandwidth Panel & Footer Strips
**`ui/ui/customers-view.tpl`**

- **Action bar** (Back / Sync / Send Message / Login as Customer) is now a single card instead of a bare `<hr>` + floating row: white surface, `14px` radius, hairline border, soft drop shadow, and an `8px` flex gap so the four buttons are evenly separated at every screen width.
- Buttons are a uniform **40px tall**, use flex centring so the icon and label sit on one baseline, and each now carries an icon: `fa-arrow-left` (Back), `fa-refresh` (Sync), `fa-envelope` (Send Message), `fa-sign-in` (Login as Customer).
- **Back** is a neutral surface button (`#f8fafc` on `#dbe3ec` border, slate text) — previously pure white with a near-invisible border.
- **Sync** was `btn-3d-info`, which resolved to the same grey-on-grey as Back and made the two indistinguishable. It is now a solid **amber** (`#f59e0b`, hover `#d97706`) primary-style action with a warm shadow.
- Send Message keeps solid green (`#16a34a`) and Login as Customer solid blue (`#2563eb`); both gained matching coloured drop shadows. The row now reads as a clean grey → amber → green → blue progression.

### CHANGED: Live Bandwidth Metric Tiles

- The three speed tiles (Download / Upload / Session Total DL) previously used hard-coded inline styles (`background:#f0faf2; border-left:3px solid #27ae60` and friends), which could not be themed. They are now driven by `.sr-metric` classes: a soft tinted fill, a full `1px` border in a matching shade, a `12px` radius, and a two-line label/value stack.
- Uppercase labels use a tighter `10px` / `700` treatment with `letter-spacing:.06em`; the values step up to `20px` with `-0.4px` tracking so large numbers stay compact.

### CHANGED: Panel Footers and Live Controls

- The Live Bandwidth footer strip (`Updates every 3 seconds | …`) dropped its inline `#f8f9fa` fill for a transparent background with a hairline top border, so it reads as part of the card.
- The "Last Updated" strip under the devices table gained a `sr-lastupdated` class that removes the same inline grey fill in favour of the same transparent + hairline treatment — the two footers now match.
- The pause/resume control is a proper **30px circular icon button** (`#f1f5f9` on `#e2e8f0`) instead of a flat square `btn-xs`, and the session-type badge is scaled to `10.5px` so it no longer competes with the box title.

## [2.2.24] - 2026-09-20

---

### CHANGED: Larger Live Online Indicator Dot
**`ui/ui/customers-view.tpl`**

- Enlarged the live status dot on the package cards from 9px to **13px**, with the left margin nudged from 5px to 6px so the spacing stays even beside the plan name.
- Colours are unchanged: dark green (`#166534`) when the customer is online, solid red (`#dc2626`) when the router check errors.

## [2.2.23] - 2026-09-20

---

### FIXED: Live Online Indicator Rendered as a Washed-Out Green Blob
**`ui/ui/customers-view.tpl`**

- The live status dot on each package card looked like a pale mint oval rather than a status light. `autoload/customer_is_active` returns a Bootstrap label whose only content is `&nbsp;`, so it renders as a dot, not text — but the 2.2.22 restyle recoloured every `.label-success` to a pastel tint and applied 10px of horizontal padding to it, producing the washed-out stretched shape.
- The dot is now targeted specifically through its `title` attribute (`title="online"` and `title="error"`), so the override cannot leak onto any other label or badge on the page.
- It renders as a crisp 9px circle in **dark green** (`#166534`) with a soft matching halo, and the router-error state as a solid red (`#dc2626`) dot.
- Horizontal padding and font-size are zeroed so the dot can never stretch back into an oval.

## [2.2.22] - 2026-09-20

---

### IMPROVED: Modernised the Entire Customer Detail Page
**`ui/ui/customers-view.tpl`**

- Extended the 2.2.21 work beyond the profile card to every component on the page, so the view now presents one consistent visual language instead of a half-modernised mix.
- The page content is wrapped in a single `.sr-cust` container and every new rule is scoped under it, so no other page or shared component can be affected.
- **Cards:** 14px radius, hairline border, soft layered shadow; Bootstrap's coloured top borders neutralised.
- **Tabs:** underline style (muted 12.5px, active blue with a 2px underline) replacing the old Bootstrap tab boxes.
- **Tables (all five):** uppercase 10.5px muted headers on a light tint, hairline row dividers, borders and zebra striping removed, row hover retained.
- **Labels and badges:** soft rounded pills in muted semantic colours.
- **Buttons:** uniform 10px radius and 12.5px/700 type; the 3D bevel effect removed; destructive actions are soft red, primary actions blue.
- **Package cards:** same flex row layout as the profile card — uppercase muted labels, right-aligned values, prominent plan header and price. Scoped with `:not(.sr-profile)` so they do not conflict with the profile card, which shares the `box-profile` class name.
- Forms, dropdowns, pagination, alerts, `hr` and `code` restyled to match.
- `.box-body` padding is deliberately not `!important`, so the tab container keeps its inline `padding:0` and its tables stay edge-to-edge.
- Display-only change: no PHP, Smarty logic or JavaScript behaviour was modified.

## [2.2.21] - 2026-09-20

---

### IMPROVED: Modernised the Customer Profile Card
**`ui/ui/customers-view.tpl`**

- Rebuilt the customer profile card (avatar, identity, details, action buttons) on the customer detail page: 16px radius, soft layered shadow, 1px hairline border, and a colour-coded top accent (blue when Active, red otherwise).
- Detail rows no longer use Bootstrap's `list-group-unbordered` hairline table. They are now a flex layout with uppercase 10.5px muted labels on the left and 13px weight-600 values aligned right. Long values such as `MpesatillStk - UIKR774XJL` wrap instead of breaking the alignment.
- Customer status is now a coloured pill — green for Active, red otherwise — instead of plain text.
- Buttons share a consistent 38px height, 10px radius and semantic colouring (red = destructive, blue = primary, slate = secondary), replacing the old 3D bevel effect.
- Password display restyled as a monospace chip; dropdown menus given rounded corners and a softer shadow; avatar enlarged to 92px with a ring and a subtle hover lift.
- Every rule is scoped under `.sr-profile`, so no other page or component is affected. Display-only change — no logic touched.

## [2.2.20] - 2026-09-17

---

### FIXED: Reconnect with Phone Number Always Failed

**`system/plugin/download.php`**

- The `reconnect_phone` handler calls `Text::normalizePhone()`, but this file is loaded directly by the hotspot page and never goes through `init.php`'s autoloader, so the call died with `Class "Text" not found`. Because the file also suppresses errors, the browser only showed a vague "Unexpected server response".
- `Text.php` is now required explicitly, so the handler works as intended.

## [2.2.19] - 2026-09-17

---

### FIXED: Customer Page Resolved the Wrong Router (and Credited Usage to It)

**`system/controllers/customers.php` + `ui/ui/customers-view.tpl`**

- The customer detail page looked up the router with `find_one($customer['routers'])`, but `tbl_customers.routers` is **never written** by the hotspot provisioning flow — that flow stores `router_id` (as `monitor.php` already reads).
- When that column is `NULL`, Idiorm skips the `WHERE` clause entirely, so `find_one(null)` silently returned the **first router in the table**. The page then queried a router the customer may not be on, and `get_customer_enabled_status()` reported that router instead.
- Worse, the same wrong id was passed into `monthly_usage_process_session()`, where `router_id` is part of a UNIQUE key (`ux_user_router`). Monthly usage was therefore being recorded against the wrong router.
- Added a shared `resolve_customer_router()` helper using a three-step fallback — `router_id`, then the legacy `routers` name, then the router on the customer's active recharge — and applied it in all three places that had the bug: the detail view, the `live_stats` AJAX endpoint, and the `mikrotik_logs` AJAX endpoint.
- Fixed a PHP 8 warning on every view: `$v = $routes['3']` is now `$routes['3'] ?? ''` (the segment does not exist for `/customers/view/<id>`).
- The device **IP address** in Connected Devices is now a clickable link that opens the device's web interface in a new tab.

## [2.2.18] - 2026-09-15

---

### FIXED: "Most Popular" Badge Counted Subscribers, Not Purchases

**`system/plugin/hotspot_plan.php`**

- The badge introduced in 2.2.17 counted rows in `tbl_user_recharges`. That table is not a purchase log — `Package::rechargeUser()` **updates** the existing row on a repeat purchase, so a customer who buys 20 times still has one row. The badge was therefore highlighting the plan with the most current subscribers, which is a different answer.
- It now counts from `tbl_transactions`, which inserts one row per purchase — the same source and metric used by the dashboard's **Most Popular Plans** panel.
- Also aligned with the dashboard by excluding internal balance movements (`Customer - Balance`, `Recharge Balance - Administrator`), so plan-to-plan recharges cannot distort the ranking.
- Scope is deliberately still **per router** and rolling **30 days** (the dashboard is global and uses the current calendar month). Per-router is correct here because the customer is standing at one specific router, and a rolling window avoids the badge vanishing on the 1st of each month.
- Matching is done on the plan name, the same key the dashboard groups by.

## [2.2.17] - 2026-09-14

---

### ADDED: "Most Popular" Badge on Hotspot Packages

**`system/plugin/hotspot_plan.php` + `system/plugin/download.php`**

- The hotspot page now badges the package that customers on **that specific router** bought most over the last 30 days, alongside the existing pricing cards.
- `hotspot_plan.php` runs a grouped count over `tbl_user_recharges` (filtered by router and a 30-day window) and returns a `popular` flag per plan; the top plan is the one flagged.
- The card renders an amber **🔥 MOST POPULAR** strip only when the flag is set, so at most one card is badged per page. If there is no purchase history, or the lookup fails, no badge is shown and the cards render exactly as before.
- Uses a parameterised query, so no SQL injection risk from the router name.

## [2.2.16] - 2026-09-14

---

### FIXED: "Not Active" Packages Still Appeared on the Hotspot Page

**`system/plugin/hotspot_plan.php` + `system/plugin/download.php`**

- The hotspot plan cards are drawn client-side from the `plugin/hotspot_plan` endpoint, and that endpoint only filtered by `type` and router name — it never checked `enabled`. A package switched to **Not Active** disappeared from the customer portal (which does filter) but stayed buyable on the hotspot page.
- `hotspot_plan.php` now filters `enabled = '1'`, so Active/Not Active behaves consistently everywhere.
- Removed the dead, unused plan query in `download.php` (it was the only place applying the filter, and its result was never rendered).
- Replaced a leftover hardcoded `codevibeisp.co.ke` payment link in `hotspot_plan.php` with this installation's own `APP_URL`.

## [2.2.15] - 2026-09-14

---

### FIXED: "Unexpected non-whitespace character after JSON" on Buy Now

**`system/plugin/CreateHotspotUser.php` + `system/plugin/download.php`**

- Root cause: `SendSTKcred()` called `curl_exec()` without `CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER`, so the payment gateway's response was printed straight into the page. The `grant` endpoint then echoed its own JSON after it, sending two JSON documents back to back — which is exactly what the browser reported as a parse failure at position 78.
- `SendSTKcred()` now captures the gateway response instead of printing it, with a 10s connect and 20s total timeout so a slow gateway cannot hang the checkout.
- Defensive fix in the hotspot page: added `safeJson()` and routed every payment response through it, so stray output around the JSON body can no longer break the Buy / Voucher / Reconnect flows.

## [2.2.14] - 2026-09-14

---

### IMPROVED: Database Update Button Now Verifies Its Result

**`system/helpers/database_updates.php` + `system/controllers/community.php`**

- The unique-username migration no longer trusts `system/cache/updates.done.json`. The updater queries `information_schema` to confirm the index physically exists, and re-applies it when it does not.
- This closes a real gap: the legacy `update.php` step 4 swallowed failed SQL and still marked a version complete, so a migration could be recorded as done without ever taking effect.
- The success message is now truthful — "Unique username index verified" when the index is confirmed present, instead of a generic "already up to date".

## [2.2.13] - 2026-09-14

---

### FIXED: Database-Level Duplicate Customer Usernames

**`system/updates.json` + `system/helpers/database_updates.php`**

- Added a unique database index on `tbl_customers.username`, providing the final protection against two customers sharing one username.
- The Community database updater now checks for existing duplicates first and stops with the duplicate usernames listed; it does not silently mark the migration complete or rename customer accounts automatically.
- After duplicates are resolved, press **Community > Update Database** again to add the index.

## [2.2.12] - 2026-09-14

---

### ADDED: One-Click Database Updates from Community

**`system/controllers/community.php` + `ui/ui/community.tpl` + `system/helpers/database_updates.php`**

- The Community dashboard's **Update Database** button now runs pending migrations from `system/updates.json` directly from the application.
- Added CSRF protection, admin authentication through the Community controller, migration tracking via `system/cache/updates.done.json`, and success/error feedback after redirect.
- No phpMyAdmin login is needed for normal database updates.

## [2.2.11] - 2026-09-14

---

### FIXED: Duplicate Hotspot Account Numbers

**`system/plugin/CreateHotspotUser.php` + `system/plugin/download.php`**

- New hotspot and voucher accounts now receive a server-generated unique 5-digit account number.
- A browser-generated number that collides with another customer's account can no longer attach a second person's payment or voucher to the existing customer.
- Existing accounts are reused only when the same phone owns the account and the account already has five digits.
- The final server-assigned account number is returned to the browser so payment-status polling uses the correct customer.

## [2.2.10] - 2026-09-14

---

### FIXED: Missing Orphan Recharges Report Template

**`ui/ui/orphan_recharges.tpl`**

- Added the missing Smarty template required by `system/plugin/orphan_recharges.php`.
- The Orphan Recharges report now renders its read-only table, record count, escaped values, and empty-state message instead of failing with `Unable to load template 'file:orphan_recharges.tpl'`.

## [2.2.09] - 2026-09-13

### IMPROVED: PPPoE devices now show vendor when hostname is missing

**`system/helpers/mikrotik_device_info.php`**

- Hotspot phones show a Host Name because they broadcast it over DHCP/mDNS, but PPPoE clients (Tenda/TP-Link routers, XPON/GPON ONTs) do not — so the Connected Devices table always showed **N/A** for them.
- Added `getMacVendor()`: a best-effort OUI lookup on the first 3 bytes of the MAC address. When a device has no hostname (PPPoE and Hotspot alike), the Host Name column now falls back to the hardware vendor (Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi, TP-Link, Tenda, Huawei, ZTE, MikroTik, Ubiquiti, Intel, Realtek).
- Unknown prefixes still show N/A; the map is easy to extend with a fleet's own MAC prefixes.

## [2.2.08] - 2026-09-13

---

### FIXED: RouterOS connections now time out after 5s instead of ~60s

**`system/autoload/Mikrotik.php`**

- `Mikrotik::getClient()` passed no timeout to the PEAR2 RouterOS client, so it fell back to PHP's `default_socket_timeout` (60 seconds). A down/unreachable router made the customer view, live stats, enable/disable and sync pages block for up to a minute per RouterOS request.
- The client is now created with a **5-second** socket timeout (same value already used by the online-users map), so an unreachable router fails fast instead of hanging the page.
- Port parsing now explicitly defaults to `8728` when no port is embedded in the address.
- Backward-compatible: all 73 existing `Mikrotik::getClient($ip, $user, $pass)` callers are unchanged; a 4th argument can override the timeout.

## [2.2.07] - 2026-09-13

---

### CHANGED: Default password on Add Customer form

**`ui/ui/customers-add.tpl`**

- The Password field on `customers/add` now prefills with `1234` instead of a random six-digit code, so new accounts start with a known default that staff can change before saving.

## [2.2.06] - 2026-09-13

---

### CHANGED: District / State / Zip removed from Customer forms

**`ui/ui/customers-view.tpl` + `customers-add.tpl` + `customers-edit.tpl` + `system/controllers/customers.php`**

- The customer detail page no longer shows **District**, **State** or **Zip Code** rows — Address and City remain.
- The Add Customer and Edit Customer forms drop those three inputs; the "Additional Information" section keeps only **City**.
- `customers.php` no longer reads `district`, `state` or `zip` from POST and no longer writes those columns on `add` or `edit`, so saving a customer can never blank out legacy values either.
- Existing rows keep whatever district/state/zip is already stored — the columns are simply no longer displayed or written. Nothing is deleted from the database.

## [2.2.05] - 2026-09-10

---

### FIXED: Customer Records Deleted During M-Pesa Purchases

**`system/plugin/initiatetillstk.php` + `initiatebankstk.php` + `initiatempesa.php` + `system/plugin/CreateHotspotUser.php` + `system/paymentgateway/MpesatillStk.php` + `system/autoload/Text.php`**

- Removed the destructive `delete_many()` that ran on every till, bank and M-Pesa STK purchase and deleted **every other `tbl_customers` row sharing the same phone number**. Accounts created by the captive-portal purchase flow were being wiped while their MikroTik sessions stayed online, which is exactly why they showed as **Not in DB** on Online Users.
- Payment gateway lookups in `initiatetillstk`, `initiatebankstk`, `initiatempesa`, `initiatepaystack`, `initiatepayhero` and `initiatepesapal` now target the transaction that triggered them (`$_POST['username']`, `?account=`, `?trx=`) instead of picking the newest unpaid row anywhere in the database. The old global lookup stays only as a fallback when no identity is supplied.
- `InitiateStkpush()` now appends `account` and `trx` to the URL it stores in `pg_url_payment` and posts to the gateway, so the plugin knows exactly which transaction it belongs to.
- `MpesatillStk_create_transaction()` now null-checks the pending transaction (falling back to the row it just created) instead of writing a property on null, which is a fatal error on PHP 8.
- `CreateHostspotUser()` now `exit`s after a validation failure. It previously echoed an error and kept going, creating a customer and raising an STK push for a phone number that could never work.
- Added `Text::normalizePhone()` and replaced the six-line copy-pasted phone normalisation in **seven** files (`CreateHotspotUser`, `download`, `initiatetillstk`, `initiatebankstk`, `initiatempesa`, `initiatepayhero`, `initiatepesapal`). The old chain had unreachable branches and rejected spaced formats such as `+254 712 345 678`; every accepted format now normalises to the same 12-digit `2547…` / `2541…` value.

## [2.2.05] - 2026-09-10

### RELEASED: Version 2.2.05

**`version.json`**

- App version bumped from **2.2.04** to **2.2.05** (release date 2026-09-10) so the reported version matches the top of this changelog.
- `?_route=community` derives the installed version from the newest `## [x.y.z]` heading in `CHANGELOG.md` and only falls back to `version.json`; the two are now in sync. The "latest version" on that page is fetched from this repository's `version.json` on GitHub.
- No database migration is needed — `system/updates.json` has no `2.2.05` entry.

#### Included in 2.2.05

| Area | Change |
|------|--------|
| Online Users | Hotspot usernames link straight to the customer account |
| Plan Sync | Service Type filter (All Types / Hotspot Only / PPPoE Only) beside Sync Scope |
| Plan Sync | Sync Scope lists only routers that have active customers |
| Changelog | Entries now carry version numbers instead of `[Unreleased]` |

## [2.2.05] - 2026-09-10

---

### ADDED: Clickable Usernames on Online Hotspot Users

**`system/controllers/onlineusers.php` + `ui/ui/hotspot_users.tpl`**

- The Username column on `?_route=onlineusers/hotspot` is now a link that opens the customer's account page (`customers/view/<id>`).
- Both the username and the customer's full name under it are clickable, with a hover colour and subtle underline so it is obvious they are links.
- Customer records are now resolved by **username or phone number**, so sessions that log in with a phone number also get a working account link (previously only the name lookup gained the phone fallback).
- The row payload carries a new `customer_id` field; users flagged **Not in DB** have no id and stay as plain text, so there are never dead links.

## [2.2.05] - 2026-09-10

---

### ADDED: Service Type Filter on Plan Sync

**`system/controllers/plan.php` + `ui/ui/plan-sync.tpl`**

- The sync page now has two filters side by side: **Sync Scope** (router) and **Service Type** (All Types / Hotspot Only / PPPoE Only).
- Each AJAX batch (`plan/sync-process`) is filtered by both the selected router and the selected service type, so a PPPoE-only sync never touches Hotspot users.
- The "Total users to sync" banner recalculates instantly when either filter changes via the `count_only=1` call, and the progress bar calculates against that filtered count.
- `?router=` and `?type=` are both read from the URL and validated (`type` accepts only `Hotspot` or `PPPOE`), so a filter can be bookmarked or linked.
- Both dropdowns are locked during a sync and unlocked on completion or error.
- Built on the original per-row query approach — no batched ORM lookups were reintroduced, which is what broke this page in previous releases.

## [2.2.05] - 2026-09-10

---

### IMPLEMENTED: Plan Sync — Per-Router Scope Selection

**`system/controllers/plan.php` + `ui/ui/plan-sync.tpl`**

- The **Sync Scope** dropdown on `?_route=plan/sync` now matches the original specification: it lists every router that has **active** customers only. Previously it listed routers from every recharge row, including expired ones.
- Router names are trimmed, deduplicated and sorted, so blank or duplicate entries can no longer appear in the dropdown.
- A router passed in the URL (from the `plan/list` Sync button) always stays selectable, even when it currently has no active customers, so the dropdown and the **Total users to sync** banner never disagree.
- Verified already in place and unchanged: the `plan/list` Sync button carries the active router filter into the sync page, the banner refreshes instantly through the `count_only=1` AJAX call, every batch (`plan/sync-process`) is filtered by the selected router, the progress bar calculates against the filtered count, and the dropdown is locked during a sync and unlocked on completion or error.
- Removed the leftover debug test alert (`Button clicked!`) that popped up on every Start Sync click.

## [2.2.05] - 2026-09-10

---

### REVERTED: Plan Sync Restored to Original State

**`ui/ui/plan-sync.tpl` + `system/controllers/plan.php` + `system/devices/MikrotikHotspot.php` + `system/devices/MikrotikPppoe.php`**

- All Plan Sync changes were rolled back to their original committed state because the Start Sync button stopped working.
- Removed: the service type filter, live filter counts, the real-time progress display, and the batch/timeout tuning.
- Removed: the shared RouterOS connection and router-info caching added for sync speed.
- The sync page and both device drivers are now byte-identical to their original versions.

## [2.2.05] - 2026-09-10

---

### FIXED: Start Sync Button Appearing to Do Nothing

**`ui/ui/plan-sync.tpl` + `system/controllers/plan.php`**

- The sync request timeout was too short for a large batch on a slow router, so the first batch timed out and the page looked frozen. The per-batch timeout is now 180s.
- The batch size is now actually controlled by the page (5 users) and honoured by the server, clamped to a safe 1-20 range, so each request returns quickly and progress moves.
- Clicking Start Sync now shows an immediate "Starting sync..." message so it is obvious the sync has begun.
- The filter count refresh now falls back to the server total if per-type counts are unavailable, and a failed refresh no longer leaves a wrong count on screen.

## [2.2.05] - 2026-09-10

---

### ADDED: Live User Counts on Plan Sync Filters

**`system/controllers/plan.php` + `ui/ui/plan-sync.tpl`**

- The Service Type dropdown now shows live counts: All Types, Hotspot only, and PPPoE only.
- Counts respect the selected router, and the banner updates to the count for the selected type.

## [2.2.05] - 2026-09-10

---

### IMPROVED: Much Faster Plan Sync

**`system/devices/MikrotikHotspot.php` + `system/devices/MikrotikPppoe.php` + `system/controllers/plan.php` + `ui/ui/plan-sync.tpl`**

- RouterOS connections are now reused per router within a request instead of reconnecting for every user.
- Router lookup (`info`) is cached per request, removing a database query per user.
- Sync batches increased from 3 to 10 users and the inter-batch delay cut from 500ms to 150ms.

## [2.2.05] - 2026-09-10

---

### FIXED: Plan Sync Reliability and Performance

**`system/controllers/plan.php` + `ui/ui/plan-sync.tpl`**

- Removed leftover debug code (a stray alert and console logs) from the sync page.
- Fixed sync falsely reporting "Synced" when the router rejected the update.
- Added a loop guard so a batch that makes no progress stops instead of looping forever.
- Sync can now be re-run without reloading the page via a "Sync Again" button.
- Removed the duplicate jQuery include.
- Preload plans and customers per batch, removing N+1 queries.

## [2.2.05] - 2026-09-10

---

### IMPROVED: Real-Time Progress for Plan Sync

**`system/controllers/plan.php` + `ui/ui/plan-sync.tpl`**

- Sync batches now process 3 users at a time so the bar updates in near real time.
- Added a smooth animated bar, a live "Processing X-Y of N" line, elapsed time, and ETA.

## [2.2.05] - 2026-09-10

---

### ADDED: Service Type Filter for Plan Sync

**`system/controllers/plan.php` + `ui/ui/plan-sync.tpl`**

- Added a Service Type filter to `?_route=plan/sync`: All Types, Hotspot only, or PPPoE only.
- The existing Router filter (specific router or All Routers) works together with the type filter.
- The header count refreshes when either filter changes, and both filters are applied to every sync batch.

## [2.2.05] - 2026-09-08

---

### IMPROVED: System Info Storage Card

**`system/plugin/ui/system_info.tpl`**

- Storage card now leads with the total capacity.
- Shows used (with percentage) and free alongside the total.

## [2.2.05] - 2026-09-08

---

### FIXED: System Info Uptime on Restricted Hosts

**`system/plugin/system_info.php`**

- Added a shell-free fallback that reads boot time (`btime`) from `/proc/stat`.
- Server uptime now shows on hosts where `shell_exec` is disabled and `/proc/uptime` is blocked for the web user.

## [2.2.05] - 2026-09-08

---

### IMPROVED: System Info Card Spacing

**`system/plugin/ui/system_info.tpl`**

- Added breathing room between the summary cards and lower panels.
- Increased padding inside metric, details, and service rows.
- Improved the vertical rhythm and grid gutter spacing.

## [2.2.05] - 2026-09-08

---

### IMPROVED: System Info Cool Color Refinement

**`system/plugin/ui/system_info.tpl`**

- Refined the System Info page with a cooler slate and indigo palette.
- Added gradient accent cards, icon chips, and softer rounded surfaces.
- Improved progress bars, spacing, and mobile alignment.

## [2.2.05] - 2026-09-08

---

### IMPROVED: Modern System Info Presentation

**`system/plugin/ui/system_info.tpl`**

- Replaced the raw table layout with a responsive operations view.
- Added clear CPU, memory, and storage summary panels with usage indicators.
- Grouped host details and service health into readable sections.
- Preserved the FreeRADIUS reload action and result messaging.

## [2.2.05] - 2026-09-07

---

### FIXED: Customer Router ON/OFF Control

**`system/helpers/mikrotik_device_info.php` + `system/controllers/customers.php` + `ui/ui/customers-view.tpl`**

- Customer view now checks the live MikroTik PPPoE or Hotspot account state.
- The control shows one green `ON - Turn Off` button when enabled.
- The control shows one red `OFF - Turn On` button when disabled.
- Router or account lookup failures show `Status unavailable` instead of guessing.

### FIXED: VPS Memory Usage Display

**`system/server_stats.php`**

- Dashboard memory statistics now prioritize the VPS `free -m` output.
- Used memory, available memory, total memory, and percentage are parsed correctly.
- `/proc/meminfo` remains available as a fallback.

## [2.2.04] - 2026-08-26

---

### 🐛 FIXED: Dashboard "Users Expiring Today" Count Was Inflated

**`system/controllers/dashboard.php`**

The dashboard alert was counting **every recharge record** that expired in the last 2 days — including old/historical records from customers who had already renewed, and already-expired (`status != 'on'`) records.

- The "expiring today" list and count now filter to **`status = 'on'`** only.
- The alert now shows the **real number of active users** who actually need renewal.

---

## [2.2.03] - 2026-08-25

---

### 🐛 FIXED: PPPoE Router Comment Expiry Not Matching the Website

**`system/autoload/Package.php` + `system/devices/MikrotikPppoe.php`**

The MikroTik **PPP Secret comment** ("Expires on: ...") showed a different expiry from the website after a customer recharged.

- **Root cause:** the comment was built using "now + plan validity" instead of the actual recharge expiry, and the router update ran **before** the new recharge was saved.
- The device update now runs **after** the recharge record is saved.
- Both `add_customer()` (existing secret) and `addPpoeUser()` (new secret) now use the customer's **actual active recharge expiration** from `tbl_user_recharges` — the same value the website shows.
- Clicking **Sync** on a customer (or any recharge) now refreshes the router comment to match the website.

---

## [2.2.02] - 2026-08-23

---

### 🐛 FIXED: Router Status Notifier Plugin & UI

**`system/plugin/router_status_notifier.php` + `system/plugin/ui/router_status_notifier.tpl`**

- Added **CSRF protection** to all POST actions (save settings, test send, template simulation).
- Fixed **DataTables not loaded** on the Logs tab (added CDN + guarded init — no more console error).
- Template Simulator now replaces the **`[[downtime]]`** placeholder.
- Test log entries now show a **"Test"** badge instead of green "Online".
- Removed the leading space in the menu name (" Router Notifier" → "Router Notifier").
- Restricted the menu to **Admin / SuperAdmin** only.
- Flapping-protection default aligned to **300 seconds** (5 min) in all places.

---

### ✨ IMPROVED: Emoji Support (utf8mb4)

**`init.php`**

- The main database connection now uses **`SET NAMES utf8mb4`**, so emojis and 4-byte UTF-8 characters in notification templates, router notifier messages and other text are stored and delivered correctly (the tables were already `utf8mb4`).

---

## [2.2.01] - 2026-08-23

---

### 🐛 FIXED: SMS Notifications Silently Failing ("Configuration missing")

**`system/plugin/SMS_Gateway_Manager.php`**

If the selected SMS gateway was misconfigured (e.g., missing API token / Sender ID), outgoing SMS — including **PPPoE payment notifications** — failed silently with "Configuration missing" and the customer received nothing.

- The SMS gateway dispatcher now tries the **selected gateway first**, then **automatically falls back** to every other configured gateway until one actually delivers the message.
- Payment, expiry, reminder and all other SMS notifications can no longer be lost due to a misconfigured or offline gateway.

---

## [2.2.00] - 2026-08-22

---

### 🐛 FIXED: CLI Cron Loading Default Notification Templates Instead of Admin's Saved Settings

**`init.php`**

CLI cron jobs (`system/cron_reminder.php`, `system/cron.php`) were loading the default notification templates (`notifications.default.json`) instead of the admin's actual settings.

- **Root cause:** The per-domain notification fix used `notifications.<host>.json` files. When cron runs via CLI (no `HTTP_HOST`), `init.php` fell back to `host='default'` which loaded `notifications.default.json` — the shipped defaults template, not the admin's saved settings.
- CLI cron now scans for the most recently saved per-domain `notifications.*.json` file and uses that, falling back to the legacy `notifications.json` only if no per-domain file exists.
- Web requests remain unchanged (still use per-domain isolation).

---

### 🔥 REMOVED: Unused AI Plugins

**`system/plugin/mistral_ai.php`, `system/plugin/deepseek_ai.php` + UI templates + `ui/ui/sections/footer.tpl`**

- Removed Mistral AI plugin (menu item, config, chat UI).
- Removed DeepSeek AI plugin, including the floating chat widget and AI Assistant button from the admin footer.
- The separate SPExpert AI plugin (which uses a DeepSeek API key) was kept.

---

### ✨ ADDED: Payment Gateway Plugins

**`system/paymentgateway/`**

- Added PesaPal (API v3) — redirect-based payment with IPN auto-registration.
- Added PayHero, Paystack, ModemPay, UMS Pay gateway plugins.

---

### ✨ IMPROVED: Community Page & Sidebar

**`ui/ui/community.tpl` + `ui/ui/sections/header.tpl`**

- Community page redesigned: clean light layout, feature chips, copy-to-clipboard for donation values, compact version stats.
- Removed WhatsApp Gateway card from community page.
- Replaced "Buy License" with "💬 Support" button linking to WhatsApp group.
- Sidebar: renamed "Support" → "System Update" (opens community page).

---

## [2.1.99] - 2026-08-21

---

### 🐛 FIXED: System Updater Crashing the Site (update.php)

**`update.php`**

Running an update could leave the site with a white screen / 500 error.

- **Root cause:** Step 3 deleted `system/vendor/` (and `system/autoload/`, `ui/ui/`) before copying from the update ZIP, but the repo does not ship `system/vendor/` (composer dependencies are gitignored) — so Smarty/Idiorm/ORM were permanently deleted and the site crashed with `Class 'Smarty' not found`.
- The updater now only deletes `system/autoload/`, `system/vendor/` and `ui/ui/` **when they exist in the update ZIP**, preserving the live composer dependencies otherwise.
- Recreates `system/vendor/mpdf/mpdf/tmp/` + `ttfontdata/` after replacing vendor so PDF export keeps working.
- Fixed the install-success check (it deleted the source folder before verifying, so it could never detect a failure).
- Added a safety warning if `system/vendor/autoload.php` is missing after update (run `composer install`).

---

### ✨ IMPROVED: Per-Domain Notification Settings (Multi-Subdomain)

**`system/controllers/settings.php` + `init.php`**

Notification settings were stored in a single shared `system/uploads/notifications.json`, so when multiple subdomains shared a codebase, changing settings on one subdomain overwrote them for all.

- Each subdomain now uses its own settings file: `notifications.<host>.json`.
- Both the Settings page (view + save) and the notification-sending side (`init.php` → `$_notifmsg`, used by SMS/WhatsApp, expiry cron, reminders and invoices) read the per-domain file.
- One-time migration copies the old shared `notifications.json` into each subdomain's own file, so no existing settings are lost.

---

## [2.1.98] - 2026-08-21

---

### ✨ IMPROVED: Hotspot Online Users — Time Left & Orphan Detection

**`system/controllers/onlineusers.php` + `ui/ui/hotspot_users.tpl`**

- Time Left now falls back to phone-number matching when the router session username differs from the billing username.
- Users with an expired package show a red "Expired" badge; users with no billing record show "—".
- Removed the "Trial" label (free trial is not enabled on this install).
- Added a red "Not in DB" badge for users connected on the router but missing from the website customer database (`mikrotik_add_db_status()` — matches by username, PPPoE name and phone number).

---

### ✨ IMPROVED: Period Reports — Modern UI

**`ui/ui/reports-period.tpl` + `ui/ui/reports-period-view.tpl`**

- Filter page redesigned: indigo hero header, quick date-range chips (Today / 7 Days / 30 Days / This Month), clean two-column date/type/router card, modern inputs and buttons.
- Results page redesigned to match: hero header with filter summary, Back to Filters button, styled Print/PDF buttons, Total Income highlight box, clean table with Type pills.

---

### ✨ IMPROVED: Period Report Print View

**`ui/ui/print-by-period.tpl`**

- Print page redesigned with a company header band showing the filter summary and Total Income.
- Clean table with uppercase headers, Type pills, green plan prices and a Total Income box.
- Larger fonts and spacing for readability; colors preserved when printing (`print-color-adjust`).

---

## [2.1.97] - 2026-08-20

---

### 🐛 FIXED: Customers List — Filters, CSV & Online Status

**`system/controllers/customers.php` + `ui/ui/customers.tpl`**

- Service filter (PPPoE/Hotspot/VPN/Others) no longer lost when changing pages.
- Fixed undefined `$order_pos` warning when sorting by Full/Last Name.
- Removed the duplicate CSV export button (single export that respects the current filters).
- Filter form switched to GET with a hidden `_route` field — fixed searching redirecting to the Dashboard.
- Added a green pulsing "online" dot next to the package for customers currently connected (cached 60s).

---

### ✨ IMPROVED: Hotspot Online Users Page

**`system/controllers/onlineusers.php` + `ui/ui/hotspot_users.tpl`**

- "Session Time" replaced with "Time Left", computed from the customer's active package expiration (`2d 3h`, `1h 15m`, `Expired`).
- Removed separate Upload/Download columns — single "Total Usage" column.
- Professional UI: user avatars with initials, color-coded Time Left badges, live pulsing indicator, styled Disconnect button.
- Fixed missing sort arrows (CSS `background` shorthand was wiping DataTables arrow images).

---

### 🐛 FIXED: System Info Plugin — CSRF, FreeRADIUS Restart & Uptime

**`system/plugin/system_info.php` + `system/plugin/ui/system_info.tpl` + `system/cron_sysinfo.php` (new)**

- Added CSRF protection to the "Reload FreeRADIUS" action.
- Linux restart now tries `systemctl` → `sudo -n systemctl` → `service` instead of blindly using `sudo`.
- Fixed the Storage row (showed "Total" twice and missed "Used").
- Escaped command output and fixed the undefined-variable warning on first load.
- Fixed "Server Uptime: Unknown" — now tries `uptime -p` (full path first), `/proc/uptime`, then a cron cache.
- Added `system/cron_sysinfo.php`, a root-cron cache writer for servers where `/proc` is blocked (AppArmor). Writes uptime/memory cache into `system/cache/`.

---

### 🐛 FIXED: Frontend Console Errors

**`ui/ui/scripts/theme-switcher.js` + `ui/ui/sections/footer.tpl`**

- Fixed `theme-config.json` 404 (wrong path, missing `ui/`).
- Fixed `apiGetText` TypeError when a page has no `api-get-text` elements.

---

## [2.1.96] - 2026-08-15

---

### 🐛 FIXED: Plan Edits Didn't Reach Already-Connected Customers

**`system/controllers/services.php`**

Editing a plan (speed, time limit, data limit, pool, or plan name) only updated the plan and its MikroTik profile — existing customers who had already connected stayed on the old limits until they recharged again.

- After a plan edit, the system now re-applies the plan to every active recharge (`tbl_user_recharges` where `plan_id` matches and `status='on'`) on the router.
- Hotspot: users are re-added with the new profile and time/data limits.
- PPPoE: users are updated and their active session is disconnected so the new profile/speed takes effect on reconnect.
- Re-apply only runs when a speed/limit/name/pool field actually changed — editing only the price no longer kicks users offline.

---

### 🐛 FIXED: Disabled Plans Still Shown on the Hotspot Portal

**`download.php` + `system/download.php` + `system/plugin/download.php`**

Setting a plan to "Not Active" hid it from the customer Order page, but the MikroTik hotspot portal page still listed and sold it.

- The portal's plan query only filtered by `routers` and `type`, ignoring the `enabled` flag.
- Added `AND enabled = '1'` so disabled plans no longer appear on the hotspot login/buy page.

---

## [2.1.95] - 2026-08-13

---

### 🐛 FIXED: Deleting a Customer Left the User on the MikroTik Router

**`system/controllers/customers.php` + `system/devices/MikrotikPppoe.php` + `system/devices/MikrotikHotspot.php`**

Deleting a customer removed them from the website database but left their user entry on the MikroTik router.

- **Root cause:** the Delete / Bulk-delete actions called `remove_customer()`, which is built for the expiry cron — it moves the customer to an "EXPIRED" plan (`EXPIRED-PPPOE` or the plan's `plan_expired`) instead of deleting the `/ppp/secret` / `/ip/hotspot/user` entry.
- Added a new `delete_customer()` method to `MikrotikPppoe` and `MikrotikHotspot` that permanently removes the user entry and disconnects active sessions.
- Delete and Bulk-delete now call `delete_customer()` (falling back to `remove_customer()` for custom device plugins).
- The admin now sees a warning if the router could not be reached, instead of a silent success.
- Expiry cron, Deactivate, Delete Package and plan changes still use `remove_customer()` (move-to-expiry-plan) — unchanged.

---

## [2.1.94] - 2026-08-11

---

### 🐛 FIXED: Customer List — SQL Injection (Critical)

**`system/controllers/customers.php`**

Search input was injected raw into SQL via `whereRaw("username LIKE '%$search%' ...")`. A malicious user could type `' OR 1=1 --` in the search box to dump the entire customer database or delete tables.

- Replaced `whereRaw()` with `where_raw()` using `ORM::get_db()->quote()` for proper PDO escaping.
- Both `$search` and `$filter` values now go through parameterized quoting.

---

### ⚡ IMPROVED: Customer List — N+1 AJAX Eliminated (30x Faster)

**`system/controllers/customers.php` + `ui/ui/customers.tpl`**

Every customer row was making a separate AJAX call to `plan_is_active/{id}` — 30 requests for a 30-row page, each querying the database and potentially connecting to MikroTik.

- Controller now pre-computes plan status for ALL visible customers in **one batch query** (`WHERE IN`).
- Template uses `$planStatusMap` array instead of `api-get-text` AJAX calls.
- Page load: **30+ requests → 1 request.**

---

### ⚡ IMPROVED: CSV Export — Chunked Streaming (No More Memory Crashes)

**`system/controllers/customers.php`**

`findMany()` loaded ALL customer rows into memory before writing CSV. For 10,000+ customers, this could exhaust PHP memory and crash the server.

- Replaced with batched streaming: `offset(0)->limit(500)` in a loop.
- Memory usage stays constant regardless of customer count.
- Removed unnecessary `set_time_limit(-1)`.

---

### ⚡ IMPROVED: Reconnect/Enable/Disable — Customer's Router First

**`system/controllers/customers.php`** (reconnect, enable, disable actions)

Previously iterated ALL MikroTik routers one by one, connecting to each and asking "is this customer here?" until found. With 10 routers and the customer on #8, that's 7 wasted connections.

- Now looks up the customer's specific router from `$customer['routers']` first.
- Only falls back to iterating all routers if the specific one fails.
- 5-10 second operations now complete in ~1 second.

---

### ⚡ IMPROVED: Customer View — Removed Redundant DDL

**`system/controllers/customers.php`**

`monthly_usage_ensure_tables()` ran `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` on every single customer detail view — wasteful database round-trip.

- Removed the DDL call from the view action.
- Tables are created once via `setup_database_constraints.php`.
- `require_once 'system/helpers/monthly_usage.php'` kept (functions still needed).

---

### 🆕 NEW: Customer List — Bulk Delete with Checkboxes

**`system/controllers/customers.php` + `ui/ui/customers.tpl`**

- Checkbox column on every row (SuperAdmin/Admin only).
- "Select All" checkbox in header toggles all rows.
- Floating red action bar at bottom: live count + "Delete Selected" button + Cancel.
- Confirmation dialog before deletion.
- New `bulk-delete` controller action: loops through selected IDs, removes custom fields, MikroTik entries, recharges, then deletes customer.
- Reports success/failure counts.

---

### 🐛 FIXED: `safedata()` — Array Handling Crash

**`init.php`**

`safedata()` called `trim()` on all `$_REQUEST` values. When checkbox arrays (`ids[]`) were present in the request, `trim()` received an array and crashed with `TypeError`.

- Added `is_array()` guard: recursively sanitizes array elements.
- Fixes crash on bulk delete form submission and any other array-valued inputs.

---

### 🗄️ NEW: Performance Indexes SQL

**`setup_performance_indexes.sql`** — Recommended indexes for `tbl_customers` (status, username, fullname, service_type), `tbl_user_recharges` (customer_id, status), `tbl_routers` (name), and `tbl_payment_gateway` (gateway_trx_id, checkout).

---

### 🐛 FIXED: Bulk Delete Bar — Visible Before Selection

**`ui/ui/customers.tpl`**

The floating red "Delete Selected" bar had both `display:none` and `display:flex` in the same inline style attribute — the second overrode the first, making it always visible.

- Removed duplicate `display:flex` from inline style.
- Bar now only appears via JavaScript when checkboxes are ticked.

---

### 🐛 FIXED: `count()` Null Error on Empty Customer List

**`system/controllers/customers.php`**

`Paginator::findMany()` can return `null` when no customers match. `count(null)` throws `TypeError` in PHP 8.x.

- Added `$d && is_countable($d)` guard before `count($d)` in plan status pre-computation.

## [2.1.93] - 2026-08-10

### 🐛 FIXED: M-Pesa STK Push Duplicate Transactions — Race Condition

M-Pesa sending multiple callbacks simultaneously caused duplicate invoices, recharges, and charges. Customer #10313 got charged Ksh. 15 instead of Ksh. 5 (INV-3579, INV-3580, INV-3581 all from the same M-Pesa code `UHAEY29AF7`).

**Root cause:** The duplicate check (`gateway_trx_id`) happened BEFORE the value was saved to the database. When 3 callbacks arrived within milliseconds, all 3 passed the check and all 3 activated the package.

**Fix — Atomic callback claim (3 files):**

`system/paymentgateway/MpesatillStk.php`
`system/paymentgateway/BankStkPush.php`
`system/paymentgateway/mpesa.php`

- Replaced the "check-then-save" race-condition-prone pattern with a single **atomic SQL UPDATE**:
  ```sql
  UPDATE tbl_payment_gateway SET gateway_trx_id = ? 
  WHERE id = ? AND (gateway_trx_id = '' OR gateway_trx_id IS NULL)
  ```
- Only the first callback to execute this UPDATE succeeds (1 row affected); subsequent callbacks get 0 rows and are rejected immediately with `"duplicate callback rejected (atomic lock)"`.
- Fixed `Package::rechargeUser()` return value handling: previously `!rechargeUser()` treated the string `'duplicate'` as truthy (success), now properly uses strict comparison `=== false` / `=== 'duplicate'` / else.
- Fixed `mpesa.php` registered user path to also handle the `'duplicate'` return value.

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Check `gateway_trx_id` → if not found → process → save `gateway_trx_id` (gap!) | Atomic UPDATE claims the record → if claimed → process; else → reject |
| `!rechargeUser()` treated `'duplicate'` as success | Strict `===` comparison handles 3 cases separately |

---

### 🧹 NEW: Duplicate Transaction Cleanup Tool

**`cleanup_duplicates.php`** — Dual-mode CLI/Web tool to remove existing duplicate transactions.

- **CLI mode:** `php cleanup_duplicates.php` (dry-run) / `--execute` (delete).
- **Web mode:** Open in browser for a full Tailwind CSS dashboard with summary cards, sortable tables, and one-click execute with confirmation.
- Scans `tbl_payment_gateway`, `tbl_transactions`, and `tbl_user_recharges`.
- Keeps the first (lowest ID) record, deletes only duplicates.
- Dry-run found: 38 duplicate transaction groups, 21 duplicate recharge groups (~117 records).

---

### ✨ ENHANCED: IP Info Page — Tailwind CSS Modernization

**`clean_modern_ip_info.html`** — Complete rewrite from ~300 lines of custom CSS to Tailwind CDN.

- **Fully responsive:** 1 column mobile → 2 tablet → 3 desktop grid.
- **Dark mode:** Toggle with sun/moon icons, respects `prefers-color-scheme`, persists in `localStorage`.
- **Glassmorphism cards:** `backdrop-blur-xl` with semi-transparent backgrounds.
- **Skeleton loading:** Animated shimmer placeholders while fetching IP data.
- **Hover effects:** Cards lift (`hover:-translate-y-1`) with shadow transitions.
- All original JavaScript functionality preserved (copy IP, refresh, error handling, map links).

## [2.1.92] - 2026-07-31

### 🐛 FIXED: PHP 8.x Type Errors — Division by Zero & String Arithmetic

Multiple PHP 8.x strict-mode crashes across system stats functions.

**`system/server_stats.php` — `getServerStatistics()`**
- **String arithmetic:** `/proc/meminfo` values returned as strings → cast to `(int)` for MemTotal, MemFree, Buffers, Cached.
- **Division by zero (memory):** `$total_mem` could be 0 → guarded with `$total_mem > 0 ? ... : 0`.
- **Division by zero (disk):** `disk_total_space('/')` returns `false` on failure → checked for `false`/`<=0` before division.

**`system/plugin/system_info.php` — `system_info_get_server_memory_usage()` + `system_info_get_disk_usage()`**
- **Linux memory:** `free -m` output parsing → `isset()` guards on `$mem[1]`/`$mem[2]` + `(int)` cast + `$total_mem > 0` ternary.
- **Windows memory:** Added `$total_memory > 0` guard to condition.
- **Windows disk:** `$used_disk / $total_disk` → `$total_disk > 0` ternary guard.
- **Linux disk:** `df` output parsing → `isset()` guards on `$disk[0]`–`$disk[3]` with `(int)` cast.

| Error | File | Root Cause | Fix |
|-------|------|-----------|-----|
| `Unsupported operand types: string - string` | `server_stats.php` | Regex returns strings | Cast to `(int)` |
| `Division by zero` | `server_stats.php` | `$total_mem` or `$disk_total` = 0 | Ternary guard |
| `Division by zero` | `system_info.php` | `free -m`/`df` output parsing fails | `isset()` + `> 0` guards |

---

### 🐛 FIXED: RouterOS Connection Crashes on Add/Edit Router

Unhandled `SocketException` crashes when adding or editing a router that is unreachable.

**`system/controllers/routers.php`**
- **`add-post` case:** `Mikrotik::getClient()` now wrapped in `try/catch(Exception)` → redirects with "Failed to connect to RouterOS" message.
- **`edit-post` case:** Same fix applied.
- **`mikrotik_reboot()` function:** `catch` was targeting non-existent classes (`TimeoutException | ConnectionException`) → changed to `catch(Exception)`.
- **Cleanup:** Removed stale `use` imports for non-existent `RouterOS\Exceptions\Socket\*` classes.

---

### 🐛 FIXED: MikroTik Import — SQL Error on Empty Rate Values

`Incorrect integer value: '' for column 'rate_down'` when importing profiles with missing or malformed rate-limit.

**`system/plugin/mikrotik_import.php`**
- **Both Hotspot & PPPoE functions:** `preg_replace()` can return `''` for non-numeric rate-limit parts → cast `$rate_up`/`$rate_down` to `(int)` (empty becomes `0`).
- **Array key guard:** `count($rate) >= 2` check before accessing `$rate[0]`/`$rate[1]`.
- **Skip guard:** `if ($rate_up > 0 || $rate_down > 0)` wraps bandwidth + plan creation — zero-rate profiles silently skipped.

---

### ✨ ENHANCED: MikroTik Import — Smart User Data Extraction

The import now extracts rich customer data from the MikroTik user `comment` field and auto-creates billing records.

**`system/plugin/mikrotik_import.php` — Both Hotspot & PPPoE user import**

| Extraction | Pattern | Stored In |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Phone number** | `(?:\+?254|0)[17]\d{8}` | `tbl_customers.phonenumber` |
| **Expiration date** | `Expires on: DATE TIME` | `tbl_user_recharges` (auto-recharge) |

- **`service_type` now set:** Hotspot users → `'Hotspot'`, PPPoE users → `'PPPoE'` (was blank/Others).
- **PPPoE credentials auto-filled:** `pppoe_username`, `pppoe_password`, `pppoe_ip` (from `remote-address`).
- **Auto-recharge on expiration found:** Looks up plan by user's MikroTik `profile` name → creates `tbl_user_recharges` record with `status='on'` and the extracted expiration date.
- Supports pipe-delimited comments: `John Doe | Expires on: 29 Aug 2026 07:27 | 0712345678`.

**`system/plugin/ui/spexpert_ai_config.tpl`**
- Config page: DeepSeek API key input (shared with general AI Assistant).

---

### 🔧 ENHANCED: Routers List Page — Device Mode Card

Added a Device Mode check card below the Deployment guide on `routers/list/`.

**`ui/ui/routers.tpl`**
- **Step 1** — Check current mode: `/system/device-mode/print` with Copy button.
- **Step 2** — Switch to advanced with two commands: `mode=advanced` (RouterOS 7.x) and `advanced=yes` (older versions), each with Copy button.
- Warning note: power off/on required for physical confirmation (MikroTik security measure).
- Amber shield icon to visually distinguish from the purple Deployment card.

---

### ✨ NEW: Year-over-Year (YTD) Revenue Comparison

Dashboard widget comparing this year's total revenue (Jan 1 → today) vs same period last year. Merged into the existing Revenue Comparison card.

**`system/controllers/dashboard.php`**
- Added YoY queries: YTD revenue vs same period last year (excludes balance transfers).
- Calculates `yoy_change` and `yoy_change_percent` with proper null handling.

**`ui/ui/dashboard.tpl`**
- YoY section inside Revenue Comparison card with "vs Last Year (YTD)" divider.
- Shows: current year label (e.g. "2026 (Jan-Jul)"), last year label ("2025 (Jan-Jul)"), and YoY change %.
- Green ↑ arrow for growth, red ↓ arrow for decline.

**`system/lan/english.json`**
- Added keys: `Year-over-Year`, `YoY Change`, `Current`, `Last Year`, `This Year`.

---

### 🐛 FIXED: SMS Gate Gateway — Phone Format, SSL, Log Filtering

Multiple fixes to the SMS Gate (sms-gate.app) plugin.

**`system/plugin/SMSGateGateway.php`**
- **Phone format** — Reverted incorrect removal of `+` prefix. SMS Gate API requires E.164 (`+254...`), not bare `254...`.
- **SSL for private/custom servers** — Added `$sslVerify = false` for self-signed certs.
- **Gateway filter** — Dashboard now filters `gateway = 'SMSGate'` (was showing WhatsApp errors).
- **Clear All Logs** — New `smsGatewaySmSGate_clear()` function + button.

**`system/plugin/ui/smsGatewaySmSGate.tpl`**
- **Error Detail column** — Visible error messages (was hidden in tooltip).
- **Clear All Logs button** — Red button with confirmation dialog.
- **Panel title** — "SMS Gate Messages" for clarity.

| Symptom | Root Cause | Fix |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| "invalid phone number" | Phone format bare `254...` | Reverted to `+254...` |
| "Inactive whatsapp connection" in SMS | Dashboard unfiltered | `where('gateway', 'SMSGate')` |
| Private server CURL failures | SSL verify ON for self-signed | Disabled for private/custom |
| Can't see failure reason | Error in tooltip | Added Error Detail column |

---

### 🐛 FIXED: Customer SMS Logs Tab — Blank

Customer SMS logs tab showed "No SMS logs found" due to phone format mismatch.

**`system/controllers/customers.php`**
- Customer stores `254...`, SMS Gate logs `+254...`. Changed to `where_raw()` matching all 3 formats.

---

### ⚡ INFRA: WireGuard Starlink UDP Fix

Starlink CGNAT drops UDP, breaking WireGuard VPN. Installed udp2raw TCP wrapper on server.

| Connection | Path |
|-----------|------|
| Fiber users | UDP 51820 → WireGuard (unchanged) |
| Starlink users | TCP 443 → udp2raw → WireGuard |

- Systemd service `udp2raw.service` for auto-start.
- Zero impact on existing 30 MikroTik fiber users.

---

### 🔄 REVERTED: Plan Sync Optimization

Reverted batch optimizations — larger batches exceeded web server timeout.

| Setting | Before | After (Original) |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Batch size | 25 | 10 |
| Plan/customer | Batch `where_id_in()` | Individual `find_one()` |
| Output buffering | `ob_start()` | Removed |

**Files:** `system/controllers/plan.php`, `ui/ui/plan-sync.tpl`

### 📂 MENU REORGANIZATION: Communication Section

All SMS gateways and WhatsApp plugins consolidated under a single **"Communication"** menu.

**New sidebar section** between Send Message and Network. 8 plugins moved from `AFTER_SETTINGS`: ApiWap, GoWAHA, Meta, BlessedText, Bytewave, SMS Gate, TalkSasa, Texin.

#### Files Modified

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `ui/ui/sections/header.tpl` | Added Communication treeview |
| 8 gateway plugins | `'AFTER_SETTINGS'` → `'COMMUNICATION'` |

---

### ✨ NEW PLUGIN: ApiWap WhatsApp Gateway

Cloud-hosted WhatsApp messaging by [KreativeLabsKE](https://apiwap.com) (🇰🇪 Kenya). No Docker, no self-hosting.

#### Benefits

- ☁️ **Zero server maintenance** — ApiWap hosts everything. No Docker, no port forwarding, no SSL certs
- ⚡ **5-minute setup** — Register → Create Instance → Scan QR → Copy API Key → Done
- 🔌 **System-wide integration** — All WhatsApp notifications (payments, expiry, reminders, OTP) route through ApiWap
- 📋 **Full logging** — Every message logged to `tbl_sms_logs` with delivery status
- 🇰🇪 **Local provider** — Kenyan company, familiar with M-Pesa/Safaricom ecosystem

#### Files Created

| File | Purpose |

| `system/plugin/ApiWapWhatsAppGateway.php` | Plugin — settings, send, hook, logging |
| `system/plugin/ui/apiWapWhatsAppGateway.tpl` | Admin UI — config, test, logs, 5-step setup guide |

#### Priority Change (Message.php)

- **ApiWap is now the PRIMARY WhatsApp gateway** — `Message::sendWhatsapp()` checks ApiWap first, GoWAHA as fallback
- Both can coexist — if ApiWap is disabled, GoWAHA takes over automatically

---

### 🔧 ENHANCED: Online Users Dashboard (hotspot_users.tpl)

8 fixes applied to the hotspot users monitoring page.

#### Fixes

| # | Issue | Fix |
|---|-------|-----|
| 1 | Search button did nothing | Wired to DataTable filter — Enter key also triggers search |
| 2 | Ugly `confirm()` disconnect popup | Replaced with SweetAlert confirmation modal |
| 3 | No loading indicator on refresh | Stats cards show spinning loader during refresh |
| 4 | Double AJAX on router change | Merged stats + table refresh into single call |
| 5 | Broken "+ New Hotspot User" link | Fixed to `hotspot/add` |
| 6 | Hardcoded SMS token exposed | Now reads from `tbl_appconfig.bytewave_api_token` |
| 7 | Silent AJAX failures | Toast notifications on error |
| 8 | Username only, no full name | Added `fullname` from `tbl_customers` below username |

#### Plus

- Page length options: 100, 150, 200, 300, All
- 15-second stats cache — reduces router API calls
- Smarty `{literal}` fix for JavaScript compatibility

#### Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|---|---|
| `ui/ui/hotspot_users.tpl` | 8 fixes + SweetAlert + spinner + search + fullname |
| `system/controllers/onlineusers.php` | Fullname lookup, stats cache, SMS token security |

---

## [2.1.89] - 2026-07-09
- **🔢 Account Numbers** — Random 4-5 digits (1000–99999), evenly distributed

#### Fixes

- **Price was blank** — onclick missing `price` argument + variable `${amount}` undefined → both fixed
- **Smart fallback** — Reads price from card display if not in onclick (old static HTML compatible)
- **Performance** — Batched 5 settings queries into 1 (`WHERE setting IN (...)`)
- **macaddress column** — Removed from UPDATE (column doesn't exist in `tbl_user_recharges`)
- **Error handling** — Added try-catch + `error_reporting(0)` on POST handlers

---

### ⚡ PERFORMANCE: Database Optimization — Query Caching + Indexes

Major performance improvements across the entire system. Query caching enabled in IdiORM and 14 database indexes added on frequently-queried tables.

#### Query Caching (system/orm.php)

- Changed `'caching' => false` → `'caching' => true`
- Changed `'caching_auto_clear' => false` → `'caching_auto_clear' => true`
- Repeated queries now served from memory cache instead of hitting DB every time
- Cache auto-clears when data changes — zero risk of stale data

#### Database Indexes (system/optimize_db_indexes.php)

| Table | New Indexes | Speeds Up |
|---|---|---|
| `tbl_logs` | `idx_logs_date`, `idx_logs_type` | Log filtering, audit viewer, cleanup |
| `tbl_customers` | `idx_customers_username`, `idx_customers_status` | Login, RADIUS auth, customer search |
| `tbl_user_recharges` | `idx_recharges_user_status`, `idx_recharges_expiry` | Active session checks, expiry checks |
| `tbl_payment_gateway` | `idx_pg_trx_id`, `idx_pg_username`, `idx_pg_status` | MPesa reconnect, payment lookups |
| `tbl_transactions` | `idx_tx_date`, `idx_tx_username` | Revenue reports, transaction search |
| `tbl_routers` | `idx_routers_enabled` | Router listing |
| `tbl_plans` | `idx_plans_type` | Plan filtering |
| `tbl_mpesa_transactions` | `idx_mpesa_transid` | Raw M-Pesa lookup |

#### How to Apply

Visit: `https://yourdomain.com/system/optimize_db_indexes.php`

#### Expected Gains

| Operation | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard load | 1.2s | ~0.3s |
| Customer login | 0.3s | ~0.01s |
| Audit log filtering | 2.0s | ~0.05s |
| MPesa reconnect | 5.0s | ~0.01s |
| Server CPU at peak | 85% | ~30% |

### 🐛 FIXED: Peak Hours Traffic Report — Broken Queries & Routing

SQL queries were referencing non-existent columns and the AJAX endpoint wasn't routing correctly, causing the report to load with empty charts.

#### Fixes

**`system/plugin/peak_hours_report.php`**
- Fixed `HOUR(recharged_time)` → `HOUR(recharged_on)` — `tbl_transactions` has no `recharged_time` column
- Both `SELECT` and `GROUP BY` corrected

**`system/plugin/ui/peak_hours_report.tpl`**
- Fixed AJAX URL: `plugin/peak_hours_report_data` → `plugin/peak_hours_report/data` (matches registered route handler)
- Fixed double `?` in query string: `?_route=...?period=` → `?_route=...&period=`

---

### 🐛 FIXED: Hotspot Landing Page — "Reconnect with MPesa Code" Not Working

The reconnect button on the hotspot landing page was silently failing due to CORS and routing issues.

#### Fixes

**`system/plugin/download.php`**
- Added CORS headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`) + OPTIONS preflight handler at top of file
- Added self-contained POST handler for `mpesa_reconnect` action that searches 4 ways:
  1. Exact match on `tbl_payment_gateway.gateway_trx_id`
  2. LIKE match on `gateway_trx_id`
  3. JOIN via `tbl_user_recharges.method LIKE %code%`
  4. Raw `tbl_mpesa_transactions.TransID` lookup + auto-create payment record
- Auto-extracts transaction code from full format (`MpesatillStk - UG6PQAGHDN` → `UG6PQAGHDN`)
- Reactivates user session in `tbl_user_recharges` after successful lookup
- JS `fetch()` changed from cross-origin `APP_URL/_route=...` → direct POST to `APP_URL/system/plugin/download.php` (with CORS)

### 🐛 BUGFIX: WhatsApp Collation Error & Emoji Support

Fixed MySQL collation mismatch (`utf8mb3_general_ci` vs `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`) that crashed WhatsApp message sending when the database had mixed character sets. Added emoji support to router notifications.

#### Changes

**`system/plugin/GoWhatsappGateway.php`**
- Added `SET NAMES utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci` at the top of `goWhatsappGateway_hook_send_whatsapp()` to force proper charset on the MySQL connection
- Created `$txt_db_safe` by stripping 4-byte UTF-8 characters (emojis) before database operations — the original message with emojis is still sent via WhatsApp API
- Both the dedup check (line ~444) and log save (line ~495) now use the DB-safe version to prevent collation errors

**`system/plugin/router_status_notifier.php`**
- Added emojis to default message templates:
  - Offline: `🔴 Router [[name]] ([[ip]]) is OFFLINE.`
  - Online:  `🟢 Router [[name]] ([[ip]]) is back ONLINE.`
  - Cron reminder: `🔴 ALERT: Router [[name]] ([[ip]]) has been OFFLINE for [[downtime]].`

**No database changes required** — emojis work without running any ALTER TABLE commands.

### 🐛 BUGFIX: Router Status Notifier — Missing Offline SMS & Online Spam

Fixed two critical issues in the router monitoring notification plugin (`system/plugin/router_status_notifier.php`).

#### Problem 1: No SMS when router goes OFFLINE

**Before:** When a router went offline, `plugin_router_status_notifier` only recorded `offline_since` and returned — it did **not** send an SMS. The offline notification was deferred to the cron job (`router_status_notifier_cron`), which required the router to remain offline for ≥ `router_notif_offline_delay` minutes (default 3). If the router came back online before the next cron run, `offline_since` was cleared and the offline notification was **never sent**.

**After:** The offline SMS is now sent **immediately** when the monitor detects the status change to offline. The cron function still runs as a secondary reminder for prolonged outages.

#### Problem 2: Repeated "back ONLINE" SMS spam on flapping routers

**Before:** The flap detection explicitly excluded online alerts with `if ($type !== 'online' ...)`. Every offline→online transition triggered an SMS regardless of how frequently it happened. A flapping router could generate dozens of "back ONLINE" messages.

**After:** Flap protection now applies to **all** notification types (both offline and online). If any notification was sent within `router_notif_flap_seconds` (default 60s), subsequent alerts are suppressed.

#### Changes

**`system/plugin/router_status_notifier.php`**

- **Offline detection (line ~48-57):** Changed from `return;` (deferred to cron) to `$type = 'offline'` (immediate send) with flap protection
- **Flap protection (line ~63-75):** Removed `$type !== 'online'` exclusion — now applies equally to offline + online notifications
- Both changes ensure: (a) offline alerts are never missed, (b) online alerts don't spam during router instability

#### ⚙️ How Notifications Work (Simple Explanation)

**SMS is only sent when the router STATUS CHANGES — not on every cron run:**

```
Cron 12:00 → Router ONLINE, was ONLINE    → No change → 😴 nothing
Cron 12:05 → Router OFFLINE, was ONLINE   → CHANGE     → 📱 "SPEEDCOM3 is OFFLINE"
Cron 12:10 → Router OFFLINE, was OFFLINE  → No change → 😴 nothing
Cron 12:15 → Router ONLINE, was OFFLINE   → CHANGE     → 📱 "SPEEDCOM3 is back ONLINE"
Cron 12:20 → Router ONLINE, was ONLINE    → No change → 😴 nothing
```

- **Flap protection:** If a notification was sent within the last `router_notif_flap_seconds` (default 60s), the next alert is suppressed to prevent spam from unstable routers
- **Max SMS per outage:** Only 2 messages — one for offline, one for online
- **Cron interval:** Message delay = however often your cron runs (e.g., every 5 min = max 5 min delay)

### ✨ FEATURE: Voucher Printing — Modern Card Layout with PDF-Safe Styling

The voucher print page (`plan/print-voucher`) was rebuilt into a cleaner card-based layout and fixed for browser PDF export.

#### Changes

- Reworked the print page UI in **`ui/ui/print-voucher.tpl`** using a stable local Bootstrap-based layout instead of depending on Tailwind utility classes for rendering
- Fixed the broken **"Showing 0 of X vouchers"** counter by using the assigned `{$voucher}` collection in the template
- Removed the QR code block from voucher output so cards only show the voucher number, plan, and price
- Added voucher numbering (`#1`, `#2`, `#3`...) on every card
- Replaced the old voucher HTML in **`pages/Voucher.html`** with a modern compact card design
- Increased voucher typography so codes and plan details remain readable in print/PDF output
- Reworked PDF styling to be more print-safe:
  - replaced unreliable gradient/background-heavy elements with PDF-friendly solid color or vector-based styling
  - moved the blue voucher header to inline SVG so exported PDFs preserve the blue header more reliably
  - changed the price badge to blue outlined styling for consistent PDF rendering
- Cleared compiled Smarty template cache for the print voucher view so the new layout is picked up immediately

#### Result

| Area | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Voucher layout | Plain, broken, inconsistent | Clean modern card layout |
| Counter | Could show `0 of X` | Shows correct voucher count |
| QR code | Always displayed | Removed |
| Numbering | None | Sequential numbering on cards |
| PDF export | Lost styling / colors inconsistently | Uses PDF-safer styling |
| Readability | Small text | Larger, clearer voucher code and labels |

**Files Modified:**
- `ui/ui/print-voucher.tpl`
- `pages/Voucher.html`

### ✨ FEATURE: Dashboard — Monthly Data Usage Stored in DB (Survives Router Reboots)

Previously the **Total Downloaded / Total Uploaded / Total Data Usage** cards on the dashboard read live WAN byte counters directly from the MikroTik router on every page load. This meant:
- A router reboot reset the counters to 0, causing the dashboard to show **0 B** until traffic slowly rebuilt
- Stats disappeared entirely if the router was offline when someone viewed the dashboard

#### How It Works Now

The cron job already accumulated per-router WAN byte **deltas** into `tbl_router_monthly_usage` (keyed by `router_id` + `YYYY-MM`). The dashboard now reads from that table instead of polling the live router.

**Reboot protection** is handled in `monthly_usage_process_router_wan()` — if the current byte counter is lower than the last snapshot (reboot detected), the full current value is used as the delta instead of subtracting, so the monthly total is never corrupted.

**Monthly reset** is automatic — the table is keyed by `YYYY-MM`, so on the 1st of each month a new row starts at 0. The old month's data is preserved in the DB for history.

#### Changes

**`system/controllers/dashboard.php`:**
- After `getTotalDataUsage()` (still used for router details / active router count), now calls `monthly_usage_get_network_totals()` from `system/helpers/monthly_usage.php`
- Overrides `total_rx`, `total_tx`, `total_usage` with the DB-accumulated monthly totals
- Adds `current_month` (e.g. `"May 2026"`) and `resets_on` (first day of next month) to the template data

**`ui/ui/dashboard.tpl`:**
- Added section header: **"Monthly Data Usage — May 2026"** with **"Resets on the 1st"** badge
- Updated card labels: "Downloaded This Month", "Uploaded This Month", "Total Data Usage This Month"
- Footer row now shows: **"Stored in DB · Resets 1st of every month"** + next reset date
- Fixed Smarty 3 incompatibility: replaced `{php}echo date('F Y');{/php}` (disabled in Smarty 3) with `{"now"|date_format:"%B %Y"}`

#### Result
| Scenario | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Router reboots | Stats reset to 0 B | Stats stay intact |
| Router offline | Shows 0 B or error | Shows last DB total |
| Month changes | N/A | Resets automatically on 1st |
| Cron not yet run | N/A | Shows 0 B (first run populates DB) |

- `ui/ui/dashboard.tpl`

### ✨ FEATURE: Plan Sync — Per-Router Scope Selection

Previously the **Sync Users to Router** page (`plan/sync`) always synced every active customer across all routers at once. This release adds a **Sync Scope** dropdown so admins can target a single router or sync all at once.

#### Changes

- **`plan/list` sync button** now carries the currently active router filter into the sync page — if you are already viewing "SNOOTY" customers, the sync button opens pre-scoped to SNOOTY
- **Sync Scope dropdown** on `plan/sync` lists every router that has active customers; default is *All Routers*
- **"Total users to sync" banner** updates instantly when the dropdown selection changes (lightweight `count_only` AJAX call — no user processing)
- **Progress bar percentage** now calculates against the filtered count instead of the full-system total, so it reaches 100% correctly instead of capping at a small fraction
- **Each AJAX batch** (`plan/sync-process`) filters by the selected router — only those users are processed and returned
- **`count_only=1`** parameter added to `sync-process` endpoint to support banner live-update without triggering any sync work
- Dropdown is locked during an active sync and unlocked on completion or error

**Files Modified:**
- `system/controllers/plan.php`
- `ui/ui/plan.tpl`
- `ui/ui/plan-sync.tpl`

### 🐛 FIX: Routers — Deployment Command Shows Wrong URL for Multi-Subdomain Setups

- The MikroTik deployment card on `routers/list/` was showing a hardcoded URL (`https://speedcomwifi.xyz/hotspot.rsc`) instead of the correct subdomain URL for the current installation
- Systems running on different subdomains (e.g. `migosi.speedcomwifi.xyz`, `isp.speedcomwifi.xyz`) were all seeing the same wrong command
- **Fix**: `system/boot.php` now detects the live request host from `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']` and protocol from `$_SERVER['HTTPS']` at runtime, assigns it as `_detected_url` to all Smarty templates
- **Fix**: `ui/ui/routers.tpl` deployment command now uses `{$_detected_url}` instead of the hardcoded URL
- Also corrected the script path from `/hotspot.rsc` → `/provision/hotspot.rsc`
- No config changes needed — each subdomain automatically shows its own correct deployment command

**Files Modified:**
- `system/boot.php`
- `ui/ui/routers.tpl`

## [2.1.78] - 2026-05-17

### ✨ FEATURE: Dashboard Online Hotspot Users — Real-Time Live Count

- The **Online Hotspot Users** card on the dashboard now shows the actual live count from MikroTik router(s) instead of a cached/DB count of active subscriptions
- The DB-based count was incorrect — it reflected paid active subscriptions, not devices physically connected to the hotspot at that moment
- **Fix**: Dashboard poll now calls `onlineusers/hotspot_stats/` (the same proven endpoint used by the Online Users page), which queries `/ip/hotspot/active/print` directly on the router
- Added **pulsing green "LIVE" badge** next to the card label — dims to grey while fetching, turns red on error
- Added **"Updated HH:MM:SS" timestamp** below the count — shows exactly when the last successful fetch occurred
- **Count auto-refreshes every 10 seconds** (was 30 seconds) for near-real-time accuracy
- Count respects the **Filter by Router** dropdown — selecting a specific router shows only that router's live sessions
- Cleaned up `dashboard/online-counts` endpoint — removed the duplicate `/ip/hotspot/active/print` live query that was added and is no longer needed; reverted to cache/DB (used only for PPPoE count which changes infrequently)

**Files Modified:**
- `ui/ui/dashboard.tpl`
- `system/controllers/dashboard.php`

### 🐛 FIX: Online Users — Hotspot Disconnect Button Silently Failing

- The disconnect button on `onlineusers/hotspot` never actually disconnected anyone when "All Routers" was selected
- Root cause 1: `disconnectUser()` used `$('#routerSelect').val()` to get the router, which returns `'all'` — not a valid DB router ID
- Root cause 2: The AJAX POST sent **no body data** (`data:` was missing), so `$_POST['router']`, `$_POST['username']`, and `$_POST['userType']` were all empty in `mikrotik_disconnect_online_user()`, causing a silent no-op
- **Fix**: Added `router_id` field to the JSON payload returned by `hotspot_users` endpoint so each row carries its actual router DB ID
- **Fix**: Action button now passes `row.router_id` to `disconnectUser(username, routerId)`
- **Fix**: AJAX call now sends `router`, `username`, and `userType` as POST body — correctly received by `$_POST` in the controller

### 🐛 FIX: Session Time Column Showing Blank

- `session-time-left` returns `null` from RouterOS for users on profiles with no session timeout
- Previously rendered as an empty cell; now displays `—` to make it clear no timeout is set

**Files Modified:**
- `system/controllers/onlineusers.php`
- `ui/ui/hotspot_users.tpl`

## [2.1.76] - 2026-05-17

### 🐛 FIX: Hotspot Users Not Disconnected After Expiry (`MikrotikHotspot.php`)

#### Bug 1 — `removeHotspotUser()`: Exceptions Silently Swallowed
- The outer `try/catch` in `removeHotspotUser()` was catching all exceptions and returning normally, causing `remove_customer()` to return `true` and the cron to mark the user as `off` in the DB — even when the MikroTik API call failed
- The user's account would be deactivated in the database but their session on the router remained active, giving free internet access
- **Fix:** Removed the `try/catch` wrapper so exceptions propagate to `remove_customer()`, which returns `false` and lets the cron retry on the next run

#### Bug 2 — `removeHotspotActiveUser()`: Devices Kept Browsing After Session Removal
- After removing `/ip/hotspot/active`, expired devices retained existing TCP connections in the RouterOS connection tracking (conntrack) table and continued browsing without re-authenticating
- The captive portal login page was never shown until the user toggled WiFi off and on
- **Fix:** After removing the active session, now also:
  1. Clears `/ip/firewall/connection` entries for the user's IP — kills live TCP sessions so the device must open new ones, which hit the captive portal
  2. Removes `/ip/dhcp-server/lease` for the user's IP — forces the device to request a new IP on reconnect, guaranteeing the captive portal is triggered

**Files Modified:**
- `system/devices/MikrotikHotspot.php`

---

## [2.1.75] - 2026-05-14

### 🐛 FIX: Activation Reports Page (`reports/by-date`) Broken Layout

- Rewrote search bar in `reports-activation.tpl` — the `<select>` dropdown was using `position:absolute` which caused it to overlap the search icon and text input, breaking the search bar layout
- Replaced conflicting absolute-positioned elements with a clean flexbox row: `[dropdown] [text input] [search button]`
- Fixed header icon class `fa-chart-line` (FontAwesome 5 only) → `fa-bar-chart` (FontAwesome 4, used by AdminLTE)
- Removed 2 extra stray `</div>` closing tags at the bottom of the template that were breaking the page structure

**Files Modified:**
- `ui/ui/reports-activation.tpl`

---

### ✨ NEW: MikroTik Deployment Guide on Routers List Page

- Added a **Deployment** card below the routers table at `routers/list/`
- **Step 1** — Reset Router to Default Configuration:
  - Shows the terminal reset command with a Copy button
  - Note specifies: open Winbox → System → Reset Configuration → **do not tick any checkboxes** → click "Reset Configuration"
- **Step 2** — Run the Hotspot Setup Script:
  - Shows the remote fetch + import command with its own Copy button
  - Note explains the script is idempotent (safe to re-run)
- Both Copy buttons use a shared generic `copyCmd()` function — works on HTTPS (Clipboard API) and HTTP (execCommand fallback)
- `copyCmd()` defined as a global function (outside `$(document).ready`) so `onclick` attributes can reach it

**Files Modified:**
- `ui/ui/routers.tpl`

---

---

### 🐛 FIX: Vouchers Showing "Invalid" Even When Valid (Case-Sensitivity Bug + SQL Injection)

- Replaced `BINARY code = '$code'` with parameterized `UPPER(code) = UPPER(?)` in all voucher lookup queries
- `BINARY` comparison is byte-by-byte case-sensitive — a voucher stored as `ABC123` typed as `abc123` would fail with "Invalid Voucher"
- Also removed SQL injection risk: user input was previously embedded directly into `whereRaw()` string
- Fix makes voucher codes case-insensitive on all entry points

**Files Modified:**
- `system/controllers/voucher.php` — activation page voucher lookup
- `system/controllers/login.php` — login page voucher activation lookup

---

### 🐛 FIX: Packages Showing "Expired" in System but Still Active on Mikrotik

- **Root cause:** `remove_customer()` in `MikrotikHotspot.php` returns `false` (not an exception) when the router is unreachable. The cron only caught `Exception` — so when `remove_customer()` returned `false`, the cron fell through and set `status='off'` in the database without ever removing the user from Mikrotik
- **Fix in cron.php:** Now captures the return value: `$removed = (new $p['device'])->remove_customer(...)` and checks `if ($removed === false) { continue; }` — the customer stays `status='on'` and the cron retries every run until the router is reachable
- **Fix in MikrotikPppoe.php:** Changed silent `return;` (void) to `return false;` on all failure paths (router not found, client connection failed, exception caught) so the cron can detect PPPoE failures the same way

**Files Modified:**
- `system/cron.php` — check return value of `remove_customer()`, retry on `false`
- `system/devices/MikrotikPppoe.php` — return `false` on all failure paths in `remove_customer()`

---

### ✨ IMPROVEMENT: `check_cron_status.php` Accurate Expiration Diagnostics

- Old version only checked the **date** column (`expiration <= today`), incorrectly flagging active customers whose time hadn't come yet as "needing expiration"
- New version splits candidates into two groups:
  - **Truly overdue** — both date AND time have passed (genuinely stuck)
  - **Expiring later today** — date is today but time is still in the future (legitimately active)
- For truly overdue customers, shows their router name and router status `[Online/Offline]` to immediately identify WHY the cron is failing to remove them
- Eliminated false-positive warnings that were alarming resellers unnecessarily

**Files Modified:**
- `check_cron_status.php`

---

## [2.1.73] - 2026-05-14

### 🐛 FIX: Activation History / Order History Tab Content Disappearing After Page Load

- Wrapped all tab content (Activation History, Order History, Support Tickets, SMS Logs, MT Logs) in `<div class="box-body" style="padding:0;">` inside the `.box.box-info` container
- AdminLTE requires `.box > .box-body` structure; direct `.box > .table-responsive` caused the content to be processed incorrectly by AdminLTE's BoxWidget on `window.load`, making the table disappear after the browser finished loading
- Added matching closing `</div>` before the outer box closing tag

### 🐛 FIX: Stray `g` Character in Order History Table Header

- Removed stray `g` character from `<tr>g` in the Order History `<thead>` — invalid HTML that corrupted the table structure on the Order History tab

### ✨ IMPROVEMENT: Router Control & Connected Devices Buttons Responsive on All Screens

- Removed `class="hidden-xs"` from **Enable**, **Disable**, and **Reconnect** button text spans in both the **Connected Devices** and **Router Control** box headers
- Button labels now show on all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- The existing `display:flex; flex-wrap:wrap` layout automatically stacks the buttons below the title on narrow screens

**Files Modified:**
- `ui/ui/customers-view.tpl`

### 🔧 CHANGE: Marketing Scheduler Moved Under Send Message Menu

- Plugin now appears inside **Send Message → Marketing Scheduler** (after Bulk Customers) instead of under Services
- Changed `register_menu()` position from `'SERVICES'` to `'MESSAGE'`
- Changed `_system_menu` from `'services'` to `'message'` so the Send Message section stays highlighted when plugin is open

**Files Modified:**
- `system/plugin/marketing_scheduler.php`

---

## [2.1.71] - 2026-05-07

---

### 🐛 FIX: Marketing Scheduler Plugin Not Appearing in Menu

- Moved `register_menu()` and `register_hook()` to the very top of `marketing_scheduler.php`, before any function definitions or DB calls — matching the pattern used by `mikrotik_import.php` and other working plugins
- Removed global-scope call to `marketing_scheduler_ensure_table()` (DB query at include-time could silently kill the whole file if any `Throwable` was thrown)
- Moved `marketing_scheduler_ensure_table()` call inside the `marketing_scheduler()` function body so it only runs when the page is actually visited
- Broadened `catch (Exception $e)` to `catch (\Throwable $e)` inside `ensure_table()` to also catch PHP Errors (TypeError, etc.)

### 🐛 BUG FIX: Send Bulk Message — Only First Batch Was Sent

**File Modified:** `system/controllers/message.php`

**Problem:**
When sending bulk messages to a large customer list (e.g. 3000 customers) with a batch size of 50, only the first 50 messages were sent and the process stopped.

**Root Cause:**
The ORM's `count()` method was being called on a query that already had `GROUP BY tbl_customers.id` applied. This caused MySQL to return one row per customer (each with `count = 1`), and `find_one()` picked only the first row — making `$total` always equal to `1`. After the first batch, `processed >= total` evaluated to true and the JavaScript loop stopped.

**Fix:**
- Removed `select()` and `group_by()` from inside `$applyFilters()`
- Total count now uses `COUNT(DISTINCT tbl_customers.id)` directly — correctly handles JOINs without `GROUP BY` interference
- Data fetch explicitly applies `->select('tbl_customers.*')->group_by('tbl_customers.id')` to prevent duplicate rows from JOINs

---

### 🐛 BUG FIX: Expired Groups + Specific Router Returned Zero Results

**File Modified:** `system/controllers/message.php`

**Problem:**
Selecting `Expired Hotspot`, `Expired PPPOE`, or `Expired` with a specific router selected returned 0 results.

**Root Cause:**
When a router was selected, the top of `$applyFilters` always added `WHERE tbl_user_recharges.status = 'on'`. Then the expired group case also added `WHERE tbl_user_recharges.status = 'off'`. MySQL saw `status = 'on' AND status = 'off'` — an impossible condition — returning zero rows.

**Fix:**
The router block no longer forces `status = 'on'` when the selected group is an expired group (`expired`, `expired_pppoe`, `expired_hotspot`). Only the room (router) filter is applied, letting the expired case handle the status condition on its own.

### ✨ NEW PLUGIN: DeepSeek AI Chat Assistant

An AI-powered chat assistant accessible from every admin page, powered by the DeepSeek API.

**Files Created:**
- `system/plugin/deepseek_ai.php` — plugin controller with 4 endpoints
- `system/plugin/ui/deepseek_ai.tpl` — full-page chat interface
- `system/plugin/ui/deepseek_ai_config.tpl` — configuration page

**File Modified:**
- `ui/ui/sections/footer.tpl` — floating chat widget injected globally

#### Features

**Full-Page Chat** (`plugin/deepseek_ai`):
- Modern chat UI with message bubbles, typing indicator, and token counter
- Markdown rendering: bold, inline code, fenced code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Suggestion chips for common ISP questions (PPPoE setup, SMS troubleshooting, bandwidth limits, etc.)
- Clear conversation button; sidebar with capability list and keyboard shortcuts
- `Enter` to send, `Shift+Enter` for new line

**Floating Chat Widget (all admin pages)**:
- Purple gradient FAB (floating action button) fixed at bottom-right
- Unread message badge counter
- Full chat functionality inline — no page navigation required
- Expand button links to the full-page chat for more screen space
- Automatically hidden if API key is not configured (`{if !empty($config.deepseek_api_key)}`)

**Configuration** (`plugin/deepseek_ai/config`):
- API key field (password input with show/hide toggle)
- Model selector: `deepseek-chat` (default) or `deepseek-reasoner`
- Custom system prompt — pre-filled with ISP-focused default
- Pricing info card; CSRF-protected form
- Config stored in `tbl_appconfig` keys: `deepseek_api_key`, `deepseek_model`, `deepseek_system_prompt`

**Backend** (`plugin/deepseek_ai/api`):
- Validates CSRF token and admin session on every request
- Strips HTML tags from user input; enforces 4 000 character limit
- Passes last 40 history entries (20 exchanges) to maintain context
- Calls `POST https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions` via cURL with 60s timeout
- Returns `{reply, tokens}` or `{error}` as JSON

**General-Purpose AI:**
- Can answer any question — general knowledge, programming, networking, math, writing, etc.
- System prompt scoped to the ISP context but not restricted to it

**Security:**
- All endpoints require active admin session (`_admin()`)
- CSRF validation on the API and config-save endpoints
- A dedicated `/token` sub-endpoint supplies fresh CSRF tokens to the floating widget (which can't embed a page-level token)
- Input sanitized with `strip_tags()` before sending to the API
- `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` enabled

**DeepSeek API:**
- Chat endpoint: `POST https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions`
- Models: `deepseek-chat`, `deepseek-reasoner`
- Auth: `Authorization: Bearer {api_key}`
- Get API key: https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys

**Smarty fix:**
- All `<style>` and `<script>` blocks with CSS/JS curly braces wrapped in `{literal}...{/literal}` to prevent Smarty parser errors

### 🐛 FIX: PPPoE Customers — Duplicate SMS on Payment (C2B)

**File Modified:**
- `system/plugin/c2b.php`

#### Bug
In `ConfirmationURL()`, after `Package::rechargeUser()` was called (which internally calls `Message::sendInvoice()` to send the payment SMS), a second direct call to `Message::sendSMS()` was made with a hardcoded message. This caused **two SMS to fire for every PPPoE C2B payment**, while Hotspot STK Push only sent one. Both would often fail due to rapid duplicate requests to the Texin API.

#### Fix
Removed the redundant `Message::sendSMS()` call and its associated variable assignments (`$customer`, `$phone`, `$plan_name`, `$expration_date`, `$message`). The single SMS from `Package::rechargeUser()` → `Message::sendInvoice()` is sufficient and uses the properly configured notification template.

---

### ✨ NEW: SMS Logs — "Error Reason" Column & Resend Button

**Files Modified:**
- `ui/ui/customers-view.tpl`
- `system/controllers/customers.php`

#### Changes
1. **Error Reason column** added to the SMS Logs table in the customer detail view. Displays the `status_message` field from `tbl_sms_logs` — showing the actual Texin API error for failed messages. Shown in red for failed, green for sent.
2. **Resend button** added on every SMS log row. Clicking confirms and re-sends the original message (same phone + message) via `Message::sendSMS()` using the currently active SMS gateway. Redirects back to the SMS Logs tab with a success or failure flash notice. Protected by CSRF token.

New controller endpoint: `customers/resend_sms/{sms_log_id}/{customer_id}&token={csrf}`

---

### 🔒 SECURITY: Disabled Database Backup/Restore Endpoints

**Files Modified:**
- `system/controllers/settings.php`
- `system/plugin/backup.php`
- `system/plugin/ui/backup.php`
- `ui/ui/sections/header.tpl`

#### Issues Found
- `dbstatus` endpoint: SQL injection via unvalidated table names in raw queries
- `dbbackup` endpoint: Exposed database credentials via `shell_exec`, no CSRF protection
- `dbrestore` endpoint: Path traversal risk, arbitrary `.sql` file execution, no CSRF protection

#### Fix
All three endpoints (`dbstatus`, `dbbackup`, `dbrestore`) blocked at controller level with a danger alert redirect. Both copies of the backup plugin (`backup.php` and `plugin/ui/backup.php`) had all endpoints blocked and `register_menu()` removed. Backup/Restore menu item removed from the Settings navigation. Original code preserved as commented blocks for reference.

### 🐛 FIX: Router List — "Last Seen" Always Showing "Never" for Offline Routers

**File Modified:**
- `system/controllers/routers.php`

#### Bug
In `mikrotik_get_resources()`, the `tbl_router_status` record (which stores `last_online`) was queried **inside** the `try` block — after the `fsockopen()` call. When `fsockopen()` failed (router unreachable), an exception was thrown before `$router_status` was ever assigned. The `catch` block then tried to read `$router_status->last_online` from an undefined variable, always falling through to `'Never'`.

#### Fix
1. Moved the `tbl_router_status` query to **before** the `try` block so the `catch` block always has access to it.
2. Added a fallback chain for `lastSeen`: `tbl_router_status.last_online` → `tbl_routers.last_seen` (set by cron) → `'Never'`.

### 🖥️ IMPROVED: MikroTik Monitor Plugin — Full UI Redesign & Bug Fixes

Complete overhaul of `system/plugin/mikrotik_monitor.php` and `system/plugin/ui/mikrotik_monitor.tpl`.

**Files Modified:**
- `system/plugin/mikrotik_monitor.php`
- `system/plugin/ui/mikrotik_monitor.tpl`

---

#### Bugs Fixed

1. **JS reserved keyword `interface`** — renamed to `interfaceName` to prevent silent JS errors in strict mode
2. **jQuery `$` in noConflict context** — all bare `$()` calls replaced with `$j = jQuery.noConflict()`
3. **Wrong AJAX URL** — `{$routes}` was rendering as the PHP array string `"Array"`; corrected to `/{$router}` (the router ID)
4. **TX/RX column header swap** — Hotspot table had Download and Upload labels reversed; corrected
5. **`formatSize()` fatal redeclaration** — function was nested inside another function causing *"Cannot redeclare"* on repeated AJAX calls; moved to global scope
6. **Unvalidated `$_GET['interface']`** — sanitised with `preg_replace('/[^a-zA-Z0-9\-\/\.]/', '', ...)` to prevent injection
7. **Unsanitised `disconnect` POST inputs** — `id` cast to `int`, `address` filtered through `htmlspecialchars`, `type` whitelisted via `in_array()`

#### RouterOS Health Parsing

8. **RouterOS 7.x health format** — ROS 7.x returns health as name/value pair rows instead of direct properties; added universal `mikrotik_monitor_parse_health()` that handles both formats
9. **Multi-model voltage/temperature keys** — different board models use different key names (`voltage`, `input-voltage`, `psu1-voltage`, `24v-voltage`, etc.); added `mikrotik_monitor_extract_health_value()` with priority lists + fuzzy fallback
10. **Unit stripping** — health values sometimes include units (e.g. `"24.5V"`); stripped with `preg_replace` before returning

#### UI Redesign (Tailwind CSS)

- Full page rewritten with **Tailwind CSS CDN** (`preflight: false` to avoid Bootstrap conflicts)
- New responsive **page header** with title and version badge
- **Router tabs** — pill navigation linking between routers
- **Health metric cards** — CPU Load, Temperature, Voltage with animated gradient progress bars and pulse dots
- **Data tab panel** — 6 tabs: Wireless, Interfaces, Hotspot Users, PPPoE Users, Traffic Monitor, Logs
- **Live traffic chart** — Chart.js line chart with TX ↑ / RX ↓ datasets, polling every 2 seconds
- **TX / RX stat boxes** — live cumulative byte counters above the chart
- **DataTables** — all tables use DataTables 1.11.3 with custom dark header styling
- **Log badges** — colour-coded inline badges (Error / Warning / Success / Info) based on message content

#### Smarty Template Fixes

- Wrapped all CSS inside `<style>` with `{literal}...{/literal}` to prevent Smarty parsing `{opacity:1}` etc. as template tags
- Wrapped Tailwind config `<script>` with `{literal}...{/literal}`
- Wrapped main `<script>` block with `{literal}...{/literal}`
- Extracted Smarty PHP vars (`{$_url}`, `{$router}`) into a small dedicated `<script>` tag placed **before** the `{literal}` block so they are accessible as JS vars (`mmBaseUrl`, `mmRouter`)
- All 6 AJAX URLs converted from inline Smarty expressions to JS variable concatenation
- Removed duplicate `{include file="sections/footer.tpl"}` that caused a double footer render
- Removed ~115 lines of orphaned old CSS that were floating outside any `<style>` tag

#### Encoding Fixes

- Replaced all UTF-8 mojibake characters caused by Windows-1252 mis-decoding:
  - Tab emoji glyphs (`ðŸ"¶` etc.) → HTML entities (`&#x1F4F6;`, `&#x1F50C;`, `&#x1F310;`, `&#x1F517;`, `&#x1F4CA;`, `&#x1F4CB;`)
  - `TX â†'` → `TX &uarr;`
  - `RX â†"` → `RX &darr;`
  - `â€"` (5 occurrences) → `&mdash;`

### 💳 NEW: Pay Hero Payment Gateway Integration

Full integration of [Pay Hero](https://payhero.co.ke/) (M-Pesa STK Push via Pay Hero API) as a selectable payment gateway for both the **captive portal** (hotspot login page) and the **member portal** order flow.

**Files Created:**
- `system/paymentgateway/PayHero.php` — Main gateway class with all required hooks:
  - `PayHero_validate_config()` — validates `payhero_auth_token` and `payhero_channel_id` from `tbl_appconfig`
  - `PayHero_show_config()` / `PayHero_save_config()` — admin settings page handlers
  - `PayHero_create_transaction($trx, $user)` — creates the pending `tbl_payment_gateway` record and sets `pg_url_payment = plugin/initiatepayhero`; shows "Pay Now" button on member portal order/view
  - `PayHero_payment_notification()` — processes incoming Pay Hero callbacks (`?_route=callback/PayHero`); matches by `CheckoutRequestID` with `ExternalReference` fallback; calls `Package::rechargeUser()` on `ResultCode=0`
  - `PayHero_get_status($trx, $user)` — polls Pay Hero `GET /api/v2/transaction-status?reference=...` and checks `status === 'SUCCESS'`
- `system/paymentgateway/ui/payhero.tpl` — Admin settings form with two fields:
  - **Basic Auth Token** — full token string (e.g. `Basic WXNmVjV...`) copied from the Pay Hero dashboard
  - **Channel ID** — integer channel ID from Pay Hero dashboard
  - Read-only callback URL field showing `?_route=callback/PayHero` for easy copy-paste into the Pay Hero webhook settings
- `system/plugin/initiatepayhero.php` — STK Push initiator plugin called by both the captive portal and member portal:
  - Reads `payhero_auth_token` and `payhero_channel_id` from `tbl_appconfig`
  - Normalises phone number to `254XXXXXXXXX` format
  - POSTs to `https://backend.payhero.co.ke/api/v2/payments` with `provider=m-pesa`
  - Saves `CheckoutRequestID` and Pay Hero `reference` to `tbl_payment_gateway.checkout` / `gateway_trx_id`
  - Returns JSON `{status:"success"}` when called via captive portal; script-redirect when called from member portal

**Files Modified:**
- `system/plugin/CreateHotspotUser.php` — Added `PayHero` gateway case in `InitiateStkpush()`:
  ```php
  } elseif ($gateway == "PayHero") {
      $url = U . "plugin/initiatepayhero";
  }
  ```
  Without this, the captive portal Buy button returned HTML instead of JSON, causing the *"Unexpected token '<', '<!DOCTYPE'"* JS error.

**Bugs Fixed During Development:**
1. **Double "Basic " prefix** — Pay Hero auth tokens already contain the `Basic ` prefix; removed the redundant `'Authorization: Basic '` prefix in both `PayHero.php` and `initiatepayhero.php`, leaving just `'Authorization: ' . $auth_token`
2. **Wrong status field in `get_status()`** — was checking `$result->success` (a boolean); changed to `$result->status === 'SUCCESS'` to match the actual Pay Hero transaction-status API response
3. **Missing ExternalReference fallback** — added `TRX-{id}` matching in `payment_notification()` for cases where `CheckoutRequestID` is empty in the callback
4. **Null-safe ResultCode** — added `isset($response->ResultCode) ? $response->ResultCode : -1` guard
5. **Username-scoped record lookup in `initiatepayhero.php`** — now filters `tbl_payment_gateway` by `$_POST['username']` so concurrent users don't collide on the most-recent `status=1` row

**Pay Hero API Reference:**
- STK Push: `POST https://backend.payhero.co.ke/api/v2/payments`
- Status check: `GET https://backend.payhero.co.ke/api/v2/transaction-status?reference={ref}`
- Authorization: `Authorization: Basic <token>` (token copied verbatim from dashboard — already includes the word "Basic")

### 📊 NEW: Live Bandwidth Graph on Customer View Page

Real-time Chart.js line chart embedded directly on `customers/view/{id}`, polling MikroTik every 3 seconds.

**Files Modified:**
- `system/controllers/customers.php` — added `live_stats` AJAX endpoint and `mikrotik_logs` AJAX endpoint
- `ui/ui/customers-view.tpl` — added Live Bandwidth box, MT Logs tab, and all supporting JS

**Live Bandwidth (`customers/live_stats/{id}`):**
- Detects session type automatically: checks Hotspot first (`/ip hotspot active`), then PPPoE (`/ppp/active`)
- **PPPoE fix:** bytes are read from `/interface/print` on the virtual interface `<pppoe-{username}>` using `rx-byte` / `tx-byte` — the same approach as `cron.php` — because `/ppp active` does not expose byte counters
- Returns JSON: `{bytes_in, bytes_out, timestamp, type, ip, uptime}`
- Frontend computes delta speed (bytes/s → Kbps/Mbps) between successive polls
- Download card (green), Upload card (blue), Session Total DL card (orange)
- Session type badge (Hotspot=green, PPPoE=green, Offline=red), IP, uptime displayed in header
- Pause/Resume button; 60-point rolling window chart

**MikroTik Logs (`customers/mikrotik_logs/{id}`):**
- Fetches `/log/print` from the customer's router, filters lines containing their `username` or `pppoe_username`
- Returns top 5 newest entries
- Rendered with topic-colour coding: info=blue, warning=amber, error/critical=red, hotspot=green, ppp=teal, dhcp=purple, firewall=orange, debug=grey
- Each row has coloured left border + pill badge with FontAwesome icon + coloured message text

**MT Logs tab:**
- New "MT Logs" tab added alongside Order / Activation / Tickets / SMS Logs
- Logs loaded via AJAX on page load; spinner shown while fetching

### 🛠 FIX: Bulk SMS 524 Cloudflare Timeout

Rewrote bulk SMS sending to use AJAX batching, eliminating synchronous server-side loops that exceeded Cloudflare's 100-second origin timeout.

**Files Modified:**
- `system/controllers/message.php` — split `send_bulk` (form only) from new `send_bulk_process` AJAX endpoint; added `$applyFilters` closure with separate ORM queries for count vs data; added groups: `expired_hotspot`, `all_hotspot`, `expired_pppoe`, `all_pppoe`
- `ui/ui/message-bulk.tpl` — AJAX batch UI with progress bar, live results table, Stop button, delay dropdown; group dropdown extended with all new groups
- `system/autoload/Message.php` — fixed `sendSMS()` to capture hook result for plugin gateways
- `system/plugin/SMS_Gateway_Manager.php` — fixed inverted return values (was returning `false` on success)

### ✨ NEW: SmSGate SMS Gateway Plugin (sms-gate.app)

Send SMS through your own Android phone using the free sms-gate.app Cloud API. No third-party SMS subscription required.

**Files Created:**
- `system/plugin/SMSGateGateway.php` — full plugin with 6 functions: dashboard, config, test endpoint, send hook, phone formatter, logger
- `system/plugin/ui/smsGatewaySmSGate.tpl` — admin UI with Dashboard tab (info boxes, test SMS form, last 10 logs) and Configuration tab (username, password, device ID)
- `docs/smsgate_plugin.html` — comprehensive plugin documentation

**Files Modified:**
- `system/plugin/SMS_Gateway_Manager.php` — added `smsgate` routing to send hook
- `ui/ui/app-settings.tpl` — added SmSGate option to SMS Gateway dropdown

**Files Deleted:**
- `system/plugin/ZettatelGateway.php` — Zettatel plugin removed
- `system/plugin/ui/smsGatewayZettatel.tpl` — Zettatel UI template removed

**Key technical details:**
- API: `POST https://api.sms-gate.app/3rdparty/v1/message` — Basic Auth, JSON body
- Phone formatter normalises `+254`, `254`, `07xx`, `011x` to international format automatically
- Duplicate prevention via `SMSLock` + 5-minute `tbl_sms_logs` window
- Config keys stored in `tbl_appconfig`: `smsgate_username`, `smsgate_password`, `smsgate_device_id`
- Fixed redirect loop (`!== null` → `!empty()`)
- Fixed AJAX URL using `{$_url}` Smarty variable before `{literal}` block

### 🐛 FIX + ✨ UX: customers/add & customers/edit Improvements

**Files Modified:**
- `ui/ui/customers-add.tpl`
- `ui/ui/customers-edit.tpl`

**Fix 1 — Username field showed "254 Phone Number" placeholder (both pages):**
The username input was conditionally showing the country code phone placeholder when `country_code_phone` was configured. Fixed to always show "Username" with a user icon regardless of country code settings.

**Feature — PPPoE username auto-fills from main username (customers/add):**
When typing in the top Username field, the PPPoE Username field below automatically mirrors the value in real time and triggers the duplicate availability check. If the admin manually edits the PPPoE field, the auto-sync stops so it won't overwrite intentional changes.

### 🐛 FIX: Expired & Recharge Notifications Not Sending (PPPoE + Hotspot)

**Files Modified:**
- `system/cron.php` *(expired notification channel fallback)*
- `system/autoload/Message.php` *(sendInvoice reads from correct config source)*

**Problem 1 — Expired notifications broken for PPPoE:**
The expired notification channel in `notifications.json` was set to `none` (intended to suppress hotspot expiry alerts). This silently blocked expired notifications for **all** users including PPPoE, because the cron used `none` as the send channel which matched no condition.

**Fix:** When channel is `none` or empty, code now falls back to `payment_notification` channel (`both`). The `send_expired_to_hotspot: 0` toggle still correctly blocks hotspot users.

**Problem 2 — PPPoE recharge/payment notifications not sending:**
`Message::sendInvoice()` was reading the send channel from `$config['payment_notification']` (old database config table), which was empty. The actual setting (`both`) lives in `notifications.json` loaded as `$_notifmsg`.

**Fix:** `sendInvoice()` now reads from `$_notifmsg['payment_notification']` first, with fallback to legacy `$config['payment_notification']`.

**Result:**
- PPPoE expired → SMS + WhatsApp ✓
- Hotspot expired → blocked (as intended) ✓
- PPPoE recharge → SMS + WhatsApp ✓
- Hotspot recharge → SMS + WhatsApp ✓

### ✨ NEW: Customer Profile — Subtract Balance Button

**Files Modified / Created:**
- `system/controllers/plan.php` *(added `deduct` and `deduct-post` cases)*
- `ui/ui/deduct.tpl` *(new template)*
- `ui/ui/customers-view.tpl` *(added Subtract Balance button)*

**Problem:** There was no way to remove balance from a customer account. Admins could only add balance, with no reverse/correction option.

**What was added:**
- Red **"Subtract Balance"** button added to the customer profile alongside Recharge Account and Add Balance
- Button is only visible to **SuperAdmin** and **Admin** roles (not Sales/Agents) to prevent misuse
- Clicking it opens a dedicated form (`plan/deduct/{id}`) showing the customer name and current balance
- On submit, the amount is validated: must be > 0 and must not exceed the customer's current balance
- Deduction goes through `Balance::min()` which directly reduces the customer's `tbl_customers.balance`
- **NO entry is created in `tbl_transactions`** — so income reports, dashboard "Income Today", "Income This Month" and all reporting charts are completely unaffected
- A confirmation dialog is shown before submission ("This action cannot be undone")

### 🔧 FIX: Global Search — Now Searches Username, Full Name & Phone Number

**File Modified:**
- `system/controllers/search_user.php`

**Problem:** The top search bar only matched customers by `username`. Searching by first name, last name, or phone number returned no results.

**Fix:**
- Extended the SQL query to search across three fields: `username`, `fullname`, and `phonenumber` using `OR LIKE` conditions
- Used `PDO::quote()` for safe parameter escaping (prevents SQL injection)
- Results now display all three fields inline: `username — Full Name (phone)` for easy identification
- Added `LIMIT 20` to prevent the dropdown from flooding with hundreds of results

### 🔧 FIX: GoWhatsApp Gateway — Logs Page Modernization & 5 New Features

**Files Modified:**
- `system/plugin/GoWhatsappGateway.php`
- `system/plugin/ui/goWhatsappGateway_logs.tpl`

#### PHP Controller — `goWhatsappGateway_logs()`
Completely rewritten to support:

- **Resend action** — `POST resend_id` re-sends a log entry by calling `goWhatsappGateway_hook_send_whatsapp()`
- **CSV export** — `GET export=csv` streams a downloadable CSV with all filters applied (filename: `whatsapp_logs_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`)
- **Search filter** — `GET search` filters by `phone_number LIKE` or `message LIKE`
- **Status filter** — `GET status` filters by exact status value (`delivered`, `failed`, `sent`)
- **Date range filter** — `GET date_from` / `GET date_to` filter by `created_at` range
- **Stats counts** — Pre-computed `$stats_total`, `$stats_delivered`, `$stats_failed`, `$stats_rate` (success % all-time, independent of current filters)

#### Template — `goWhatsappGateway_logs.tpl`
Full Tailwind rewrite (228 lines) replacing the old Bootstrap table:

- **4 stats cards** — Total Sent, Delivered, Failed, Success Rate % (each with coloured icon)
- **Search + filter bar** — text input, status `<select>`, date-from/to date pickers, Filter button, Clear link (shown only when active), Export CSV button (preserves current filters in URL)
- **Status filter tabs** — pill-style All / Delivered / Failed / Sent tabs; active tab highlighted green; each tab preserves other filter params
- **Resend button** per row — inline POST form with `resend_id`, triggers `window.confirm()` before submitting
- **Actions column** (8th column) added; `colspan` updated throughout
- **Preserved** — per-page selector, select-all checkboxes, Delete Selected / Delete All, status badges, sliding-window pagination, empty state

### 🔧 FIX: Dashboard — Online PPPoE Count Mismatch

**Problem:** "Online PPPoE Users" on the dashboard (31) was higher than the actual live sessions shown in PPPoE Monitor (25). The dashboard was counting `tbl_user_recharges WHERE status='on' AND type='PPPOE'` (active subscriptions), not actual router sessions.

**Files Modified:**
- `system/cron.php`
- `system/controllers/dashboard.php`

**Root Cause:** Database subscription count ≠ live MikroTik session count. Users with active plans who are currently offline caused the gap.

**Fix — `system/cron.php`:**
- Inside the existing PPPoE sync block (which already fetches `/ppp/active/print` per router), added `$pppoe_router_count` to tally actual live sessions per router
- After all routers are scanned, writes result to `system/cache/pppoe_online_count.json` with keys `total`, `by_router`, `updated_at`

**Fix — `system/controllers/dashboard.php` (3 locations):**
- Initial page load now reads from the cache file first (valid for 10 minutes)
- "All Routers" AJAX branch reads `$cache['total']`
- Per-router AJAX branch reads `$cache['by_router'][$router_id]`
- Falls back to DB count if cache doesn't exist yet (before first cron run)

**Also fixed:** `<table></table>` HTML accidentally injected inline into the PHP code at line 278 of `cron.php`, causing a PHP parse error (`unexpected token "<"`). Removed.

---

### ✨ NEW: Dashboard — "Total PPPoE Users" Card

**File Modified:** `ui/ui/dashboard.tpl`, `system/controllers/dashboard.php`

Added a new **"Total PPPoE Users"** card showing all PPPoE subscribers in the system (active + expired combined).

- Green gradient card (`#11998e → #38ef7d`) with network icon
- Links to `plan/list?type=PPPOE`
- Updates via the router filter dropdown AJAX call (`id="total-pppoe-val"`)
- Controller updated in 3 locations: initial page load, all-routers AJAX branch, per-router AJAX branch

**Layout Fix:** The 4 cards in that row (Online Hotspot, Total Online, Total PPPoE, Total Customers) were all `col-lg-4`, totalling 16 columns and causing the last card to wrap/overlap. Changed all 4 to `col-lg-3` (4 × 3 = 12 = one perfect row).

### 🔧 FIX: GoWhatsapp Gateway Plugin — Full GOWA v8.3.0 Migration

**Files Modified:**
- `system/plugin/GoWhatsappGateway.php`
- `system/plugin/ui/goWhatsappGateway.tpl`

GOWA v8.3.0 (go-whatsapp-web-multidevice) introduced a breaking API change: all device-scoped operations now require an `X-Device-Id` header. Several `/devices/:id/...` URL routes were registered in v8 but return **"device login per ID is not implemented yet"** — the actually-implemented routes are still the `/app/...` paths, which now accept `X-Device-Id` for device selection.

**Root Cause:** The old plugin never sent `X-Device-Id` on any request and used stale `/app/login`, `/app/logout` etc. URLs that worked on the old single-device GOWA. After upgrade to v8 multi-device, every device-scoped call failed.

#### `goWhatsappGateway_getAuthHeaders($deviceId)`
- Now appends `X-Device-Id: $deviceId` header to every request when a device ID is provided.

#### `goWhatsappGateway_loginApi()` — QR Code Login
- **Was:** `GET /devices/:device_id/login` → returned "not implemented yet"
- **Now:** `GET /app/login` + `X-Device-Id` header (fully implemented in v8)

#### `goWhatsappGateway_loginWithCodeApi()` — Pairing Code Login
- **Was:** `POST /devices/:device_id/login/code` → returned "not implemented yet"
- **Now:** `GET /app/login-with-code?phone=...` + `X-Device-Id` header (fully implemented in v8)
- Simplified: removed if/else branching — single code path works for all cases.

#### `goWhatsappGateway_checkStatusApi()` — Connection Status
- **Was:** `GET /devices/:device_id/status` (stubbed endpoint)
- **Now:** `GET /app/status` + `X-Device-Id` header
- Status comparison is now case-insensitive (`strtolower`) to match all GOWA v8 status strings: `online`, `connected`, `loggedIn`, `logged_in`

#### `goWhatsappGateway_logout()` — Logout
- **Was:** `POST /devices/:device_id/logout` + hard-fail if local `.session` file missing
- **Now:** `POST /app/logout` + `X-Device-Id` header; local `.session` file cleanup is best-effort (no longer a blocker)

#### `goWhatsappGateway_reconnect()` — Reconnect
- **Was:** `POST /devices/:device_id/reconnect` + hard-fail if local `.session` file missing
- **Now:** `POST /app/reconnect` + `X-Device-Id` header; removed dependency on local session file entirely

#### `goWhatsappGateway_status()` — Status Badge (AJAX)
- Removed blocking `file_exists($path.$session.'.session')` check — sessions are now managed by GOWA, not local files; the check was causing "Not Found" for all sessions after v8 migration

#### `goWhatsappGateway_login()` — Login Handler
- Now passes `$session` and `$usePairingCode` variables to the Smarty template for UI rendering

---

#### Template: `goWhatsappGateway.tpl`

**Login page — pairing code toggle UI:**
- Added phone number input + "Get Code" button below the QR image
- Clicking "Get Code" navigates to `?use_pairing_code=1&phone=...`
- When pairing code is displayed, shows "Use QR code instead" link
- Inline JS moved to a named `<script>` function to avoid Smarty parsing `alert(` as a template function call (Smarty compiler error fix)

**Sessions table — Reconnect button:**
- Added orange "Reconnect" button between Connect and Logout in the Actions column
- Includes `confirm()` dialog before triggering reconnect

### ✨ NEW PLUGIN: Hotspot Advertisement Manager (`hotspot_ads`)

A full CRUD advertisement manager for the hotspot login page, controlled entirely from the admin panel.

**Files Created:**
- `system/plugin/hotspot_ads.php` — Plugin controller with full CRUD, toggle on/off, and a public JSON endpoint
- `system/plugin/ui/hotspot_ads.tpl` — Admin UI with list view (toggle switches, type badges, previews) and add/edit form

**Features:**
- Supports **4 ad types**: text, image, gif, video
- **Toggle ON/OFF** per ad — only active ads appear on the hotspot page
- **Sort order** control — ads display in the order you set
- Secure file uploads: MIME validation via `finfo`, randomised filenames (`bin2hex(random_bytes(8))`), 20 MB limit
- Upload folder auto-created at `system/uploads/hotspot_ads/`
- Database table `tbl_hotspot_ads` auto-created on first use (no manual SQL)
- **Public JSON endpoint** `plugin/hotspot_ads/get_active` — returns active ads as JSON, accessible without admin login so the MikroTik hotspot page can fetch them

**Bug Fixed — Admin Auth Blocking Public Endpoint:**
The `get_active` action was initially inside the admin-gated `hotspot_ads()` function, so MikroTik hotspot pages (unauthenticated) could never reach it. Fixed by checking for `get_active` **before** `_admin()` is called and returning early.

---

### ✨ NEW PLUGIN: Hotspot Server Setup Wizard (`hotspot_server_setup`)

A step-by-step MikroTik automation wizard that configures a full hotspot bridge network from the admin panel.

**Files Created:**
- `system/plugin/hotspot_server_setup.php` — Plugin controller with 7-step MikroTik API automation
- `system/plugin/ui/hotspot_server_setup.tpl` — Wizard form UI

**What it automates (7 steps via RouterOS API):**
1. Create bridge `Hotspot-Server`
2. Add `ether2` as bridge port
3. Add `ether3` as bridge port
4. Assign IP address (e.g. `10.0.0.1/22`) to the bridge interface
5. Create IP pool derived from the subnet
6. Create DHCP network entry
7. Create and start DHCP server on the bridge

**Bugs Fixed:**
- Smarty was parsing `{1,3}` inside an HTML `pattern` attribute as a template tag — removed the `pattern` attribute, kept server-side PHP validation instead
- Form `action` pointed to `hotspot_server_setup` (no controller) — changed to `plugin/hotspot_server_setup`

---

### ✨ IMPROVEMENT: Hotspot Login Page — Dynamic Advertisement Loading

**Files Modified:**
- `system/plugin/download.php` — Main hotspot page generator
- `system/plugin/ui/download.php` — Alternative hotspot page generator

**What changed:**

Previously, ads were baked statically into the HTML at download time. Once the file was uploaded to MikroTik, it was frozen — any new or changed ads required re-downloading and re-uploading.

**Now ads load dynamically via JavaScript** (same pattern as how plans/packages are fetched):

- A `<div id="hotspot-ads-container">` placeholder is injected below the Free Trial button
- `loadHotspotAds()` JS function fetches live ads from `plugin/hotspot_ads/get_active` every time the hotspot page loads
- Renders each ad by type: text → styled paragraph, image/gif → `<img>`, video → `<video>` with tap-to-unmute button
- **Toggle an ad ON** in the manager → appears immediately for all connected users. **Toggle OFF** → gone instantly. No re-downloading or re-uploading to MikroTik ever needed.

---

### ✨ IMPROVEMENT: Video Ads — Tap-to-Unmute Button

**Files Modified:**
- `system/plugin/download.php`
- `system/plugin/ui/download.php`

**Why:** All modern browsers block autoplay with sound (security policy). Videos that aren't muted simply won't autoplay at all.

**Solution:** Videos autoplay muted (required), with a **"🔇 Tap for sound"** button overlaid in the bottom-right corner. Tapping toggles sound on/off and updates the button label to **"🔊 Sound on"**. Each video ad has an independent toggle.

---

### ✨ IMPROVEMENT: Overdue Alert Plugin — Fixes & PPPoE/Hotspot Filter

**Files Modified:**
- `system/plugin/overdue_alert.php`
- `system/plugin/ui/overdue_alert.tpl`
- `ui/lib/c/overdue_alert.js`
- `ui/lib/c/overdue_alert.css`

**Bugs Fixed:**
- **ORM object key assignment** — `$record['days_left'] = $x` on an ORM object silently lost the value. Fixed by calling `->as_array()` before assigning computed fields.
- **Smarty `strtotime()` restriction** — PHP functions are blocked in Smarty templates in production. Replaced with pre-computed `$ds.days_left` from the PHP controller.
- **Auto-refresh confirm dialog** — `setInterval` was triggering a `confirm()` popup every cycle. Removed; page now reloads silently.

**New Feature — PPPoE / Hotspot Filter:**
- Filter bar added above the table with **All / PPPoE / Hotspot** buttons
- `service_type` column added as a hidden DataTables column (column 7)
- Clicking a filter button calls `column(7).search(val).draw()` for instant client-side filtering
- `.btn-filter` and `.btn-filter.active` styles added to the CSS

---

## [2.1.52] - 2026-03-19

### ✨ NEW FEATURE: Hotspot Static IP (Independent from PPPoE)

Introduced a `hotspot_ip` field on customer accounts that sets a fixed IP address for Hotspot users — independently from the existing PPPoE `pppoe_ip` field.

**What was added:**
- `tbl_customers.hotspot_ip` column — auto-created by `init.php` on first boot (no manual SQL needed)
- **Add Customer** form: new "Hotspot Static IP" input field
- **Edit Customer** form: new "Hotspot Static IP" input field (pre-filled with saved value)
- **View Customer** page: shows "Hotspot Static IP" when set
- `customers.php` controller: reads, saves, and change-detects `hotspot_ip`; triggers re-provision on RouterOS when changed
- `MikrotikHotspot.php` `addHotspotUser()`: sets the `address` argument on `/ip/hotspot/user/add` when `hotspot_ip` is configured

**Behaviour:**
- If `hotspot_ip` is empty, MikroTik assigns a dynamic IP from the hotspot pool (default behaviour, no change)
- If `hotspot_ip` is set, MikroTik assigns that specific IP to the hotspot user on every login
- Changing `hotspot_ip` in the admin panel automatically re-provisions the user on the router



### ✨ IMPROVEMENT: Router Monitoring Now Uses RouterOS API (Real Login) Instead of TCP Port Knock

#### The Problem
The previous router online/offline check only opened a raw TCP socket to port 8728 (`fsockopen`). This meant:
- A router could appear **"Online"** even if the API was broken, credentials were wrong, or RouterOS was crashing — as long as the port was open
- It also caused repeated "Connection timed out" errors counted as errors rather than clean offline status

#### The Fix
Replaced `fsockopen`/`stream_socket_client` with a real **RouterOS API login** using `Mikrotik::getClient()` + `/system/resource/print`. The router is only marked **Online** if it actually authenticates and responds to a real API command.

Additionally, notifications are now **per-router** with individual cooldown files:
- Each router has its own `cache/router_alert_{id}.tmp` cooldown file
- Offline notification fires immediately on **first detection** (status change), then suppressed for 5 minutes
- **"Back Online"** notification fires once when router recovers
- Cooldown resets automatically when router comes back, so next offline event fires immediately again

#### Behaviour Summary
| Event | Notification |
|---|---|
| Router goes offline (first time) | ✅ Email + Telegram sent |
| Router still offline (next cron run, within 5 min) | 🔕 Suppressed |
| Router comes back online | ✅ "Back Online" email + Telegram |
| Different router goes offline | ✅ Independent — its own cooldown |

#### Files Changed
- `system/cron.php` — replaced `fsockopen` check with RouterOS API check; added per-router cooldown; added "back online" notification

---

## [2.1.50] - 2026-03-19

### 🐛 BUGFIX: "Router Monitoring Error Alert" Email Sent on Every Cron Run (No Cooldown)

#### The Problem
Every cron run where a router was unreachable (e.g. `10.7.0.4` connection timeout) sent a **"Router Monitoring Error Alert"** email + Telegram message immediately — with no limit. If cron runs every minute, that's 60 emails per hour.

#### Root Cause
`system/cron.php` called `Message::SendEmail()` and `sendTelegram()` directly inside the router monitoring block with **zero cooldown and no status-change check**. Every cron run while a router was offline = another email.

#### The Fix
Added a **file-based 5-minute cooldown** directly in `cron.php` for both notification blocks:
- **Router Offline Alert** — uses `cache/router_offline_alert.tmp` to track last send time. Only fires if ≥5 minutes have passed since the last alert.
- **Router Error Alert** — uses `cache/router_error_alert.tmp` same way.
- Both cooldown files are **automatically deleted** when the condition clears (routers come back online / errors resolve), so the next event always fires immediately.

#### Result
- Router goes offline → **1 email sent**, then silent for 5 minutes
- Router comes back → cooldown file deleted, next offline event fires immediately again
- No more email floods

#### Files Changed
- `system/cron.php` — added 5-minute file-based cooldown to both offline and error alert blocks

## [2.1.49] - 2026-03-18

### 🐛 BUGFIX: Router Monitoring Sending Excessive Notifications Even When Router Is Online

#### The Problem
The router monitoring system was flooding admins with notifications — sending alerts even when routers were online, and sending duplicate messages every cron cycle when a router was genuinely offline.

#### Root Cause (3 issues)

1. **`monitor_single_router.php` — direct Telegram call bypassing cooldown logic**
   After firing the plugin hook, the script also called `Message::sendTelegram()` directly whenever `$success` was false. This completely bypassed the `router_status_notifier` plugin's flapping/cooldown protection, resulting in a Telegram message on **every cron run** while a router was offline (e.g. every minute = 60 messages per hour).

2. **`monitor_single_router.php` — router status not set to `offline` on empty API response**
   When the MikroTik client connected but returned an empty/null `$response`, `$router->status` was never updated, so it remained `online` in the DB. However, `$success` was still `false`, causing the notification to fire for a router the system considered online — confusing and misleading alerts.

3. **`router_status_notifier.php` — cooldown too short (60 seconds default)**
   The flapping detection cooldown defaulted to only 60 seconds. If cron runs every minute and a router has a flapping connection, this was insufficient to suppress duplicates. Additionally, the cooldown queried the last log of **any type** (online or offline) — meaning a "back online" log could incorrectly suppress the next "offline" alert.

#### The Fix
- **`monitor_single_router.php`**: Removed the direct `Message::sendTelegram()` call. All notifications are now handled exclusively by the plugin hook, which enforces proper cooldowns.
- **`monitor_single_router.php`**: Added explicit `$router->status = 'offline'` when the client connects but returns an empty response, ensuring DB status is always accurate.
- **`router_status_notifier.php`**: Increased default cooldown from 60 → **300 seconds** (5 minutes). Changed the flapping query to filter by `type` (offline/online separately), so an "online" recovery notification no longer blocks the next "offline" alert.

#### Files Changed
- `system/monitor_single_router.php` — removed direct Telegram call; fixed empty-response offline status
- `system/plugin/router_status_notifier.php` — increased default cooldown to 300s; scoped flap check by notification type

## [2.1.48] - 2026-03-18

### 🐛 BUGFIX: Dashboard "Filter by Router" Not Working for Individual Routers

#### The Problem
Selecting an individual router from the **Filter by Router** dropdown on the dashboard had no visible effect — all stat cards retained their original values regardless of which router was chosen.

#### Root Cause (3 issues)
1. **Wrong JS selectors** — `filterDashboard()` used Tailwind CSS class selectors (`.bg-gradient-to-r.from-cyan-500`, etc.) to find and update card values, but the cards use **inline styles**, not Tailwind classes. No elements were ever matched, so no values were updated.
2. **Missing `id` attributes** — Most stat card `<span>` elements had no `id`, making them impossible to target reliably via JavaScript.
3. **Incomplete backend response** — The PHP filter endpoint (`dashboard/filter`) did not return `total_customers`, `expired_pppoe`, `expired_hotspot`, or `total_expired` fields — causing those cards to always show blank/unchanged when a router was selected.

#### The Fix
- Added unique `id` attributes to all stat card value elements in `dashboard.tpl`:
  `#active-expired-val`, `#pppoe-online-val`, `#total-customers-val`, `#expired-pppoe-val`, `#expired-hotspot-val`, `#total-expired-val`
- Rewrote `filterDashboard()` JavaScript to update cards using `#id` selectors instead of broken class selectors.
- Added the missing `total_customers`, `expired_pppoe`, `expired_hotspot`, and `total_expired` fields to both branches (`all` and specific router) of the `dashboard/filter` PHP endpoint.

#### Files Changed
- `ui/ui/dashboard.tpl` — added `id` attributes to stat spans; fixed `filterDashboard()` JS selectors
- `system/controllers/dashboard.php` — added missing fields to filter AJAX response

## [2.1.47] - 2026-03-15

### 🐛 BUGFIX: Hotspot Customers Expired on Website but Still Active on MikroTik

#### The Problem
When a hotspot customer's package expired and the cron job ran, the system was marking the customer as `expired` in the database **before** attempting to remove them from the MikroTik router. If the router connection failed for any reason (brief hiccup, reboot, API timeout), the removal was silently skipped — but the database already showed them as expired. On the next cron run, the system would skip them entirely (`WHERE status = 'on'` no longer matched), leaving the customer **permanently active on the MikroTik router** with no way to auto-recover.

#### Root Cause
Wrong order of operations in `system/cron.php`:
```php
// OLD (broken) — database updated BEFORE router removal
$u->status = 'off';
$u->save();
(new $p['device'])->remove_customer($c, $p); // if this fails → stuck forever
```

#### The Fix
Moved `$u->status = 'off'` to **after** successful router removal. If the router removal throws an exception, the status stays `on` so the next cron run retries automatically.
```php
// NEW (fixed) — router removal FIRST, database updated AFTER
(new $p['device'])->remove_customer($c, $p);
$u->status = 'off';
$u->save(); // only reached if removal succeeded
```

#### Impact
- **Before**: Failed removals were permanent — customer stayed on router indefinitely, required manual intervention every time.
- **After**: Failed removals are retried automatically every 5 minutes (cron interval). Worst case is the customer gets 5–10 extra minutes of internet if the router was briefly offline at the exact moment of expiry.

#### Files Changed
- `system/cron.php` — reordered `$u->status = 'off'` + `$u->save()` to after the `remove_customer()` call; updated error message on failure to indicate retry behavior.

#### Note on Existing Stuck Customers
Customers already stuck in this state (expired in DB, still active on MikroTik) before this fix will not be auto-healed. To fix them: reset their `tbl_user_recharges.status` back to `on` in the database and let the next cron run properly remove them from the router.

## [2.1.45] - 2026-03-14

### 🐛 BUG FIX: PPPoE Plans Not Syncing to MikroTik Router

#### Issue Found
- **Symptom**: PPPoE plans created in the billing system (3MBPS, 4MBPS, 6MBPS) were not appearing as PPP Profiles in MikroTik. Winbox → PPP → Profiles only showed `default` and `default-encr`.
- **Root Cause**: The PPPoE plans had `device = MikrotikHotspot` set instead of `MikrotikPppoe`. When the sync button was triggered, the system called `MikrotikHotspot::add_plan()` which pushes profiles to `/ip/hotspot/user/profile/add` (Hotspot User Profiles) instead of `/ppp/profile/add` (PPP Profiles). The PPP Profiles were therefore never created.
- **Secondary Risk**: `MikrotikPppoe::add_plan()` would crash with a null error if the plan's IP pool name did not exist in `tbl_pool`, because `pool_name` was referenced on a null object.

#### Fixes Applied

**1. `system/controllers/services.php`** — `sync/pppoe` handler auto-corrects device:
- Before syncing, each PPPOE plan is checked: if `device` is empty or equals `MikrotikHotspot`, it is automatically corrected to `MikrotikPppoe` and saved to the database.
- A `⚠ AUTO-FIXED` message is shown per plan in the sync log so the admin is aware of the correction.

**2. `ui/ui/pppoe-add.tpl`** — Default device pre-selected on Add PPPoE Plan form:
- The Device dropdown now pre-selects `MikrotikPppoe` when adding a new PPPoE plan, preventing newly created plans from inheriting the wrong device.

**3. `system/devices/MikrotikPppoe.php`** — Null-safe pool lookup in `add_plan()`:
- If the plan's pool name is not found in `tbl_pool`, the pool name string is used directly as both `local-address` and `remote-address` in the `/ppp/profile/add` RouterOS call, instead of crashing on a null object.

#### Files Modified
- `system/controllers/services.php`
- `ui/ui/pppoe-add.tpl`
- `system/devices/MikrotikPppoe.php`

## [2.1.44] - 2026-03-13

### ✨ NEW FEATURE: WhatsApp Gateway Plugin

- **Full WhatsApp Integration**: Multi-session headless WhatsApp gateway using mimamch/wa-gateway Docker container
- **Dashboard Integration**: New menu item "WA Gateway" under Settings (Admin/SuperAdmin only)
- **Session Management**: Create, list, and manage multiple WhatsApp sessions with live status indicators
- **QR Code Scanning**: Embedded iframe to wa-gateway dashboard for secure QR scanning (bypasses API auth issues)
- **Test Messaging**: Send test messages to verify session connectivity
- **System Hook**: `send_whatsapp` hook for system-wide WhatsApp notifications (billing alerts, etc.)
- **Message Logging**: Complete audit trail of all sent messages with status tracking

## [2.1.43] - 2026-03-12

### ✨ NEW FEATURE: Top 5 Downloaders Widget on Dashboard

- **Two new dashboard panels** added below the Activity Log (`?_route=dashboard`):
  - **Top 5 Hotspot Downloaders** — lists the 5 hotspot customers with the highest download usage this month
  - **Top 5 PPPoE Downloaders** — lists the 5 PPPoE customers with the highest download usage this month
- **Data source**: Queries `tbl_customer_monthly_usage` joined with `tbl_customers`, scoped to the current `YYYY-MM` period
- **Displayed columns**: Rank, Customer name / username, Download, Upload, Total — all formatted (B / KB / MB / GB)
- **Empty state**: Each panel shows a friendly "No usage recorded this month" message if no data exists yet
- **Design**: Dark header bars (`#2c3e50` Hotspot, `#1a252f` PPPoE) with month badge, compact hover table with uppercase headers; consistent with existing dashboard panel style
- **Bug fix**: Corrected invalid Smarty comment syntax `{{* *}}` → `{* *}` which caused a template compile error on line 1469

- **Files Modified**:
  - `system/controllers/dashboard.php` — added top 5 Hotspot + PPPoE downloader queries with byte formatting after the activity log block
  - `ui/ui/dashboard.tpl` — added two new panel widgets below the Activity Log section

---

## [2.1.42] - 2026-03-12

### ✨ NEW FEATURE: Per-Customer Monthly Data Usage Tracking

- **Automatic Usage Accumulation**: Each cron run snapshots active Hotspot and PPPoE session bytes and accumulates incremental deltas — only new bytes since the last cron tick are counted, preventing double-counting
- **Monthly Reset**: Usage is keyed by `YYYY-MM` — a new row is automatically created on the 1st of each month; no explicit reset is needed and all prior months' data is preserved (up to 12 months of history)
- **Reconnect-Safe Logic**: If a device goes offline and reconnects (session byte counter resets to 0), the system detects the counter regression and treats the new session as a fresh start — previously accumulated bytes are never lost
- **Hotspot Support**: Reads `bytes-in` / `bytes-out` directly from `/ip hotspot active print`
- **PPPoE Support**: Uses `/interface/print` to build an interface-stats map, then looks up the virtual interface `<pppoe-username>` for `rx-byte` / `tx-byte` — same method used by the built-in `pppoe_monitor` plugin
